3 Converting yacc or bison Grammars

 (require parser-tools/yacc-to-scheme)

(trans file) → any/c
  file : path-string?
Reads a C yacc/bison grammar from file and produces an s-expression that
represents a Racket parser for use with parser.

This function is intended to assist in the manual conversion of grammars for
use with parser, and not as a fully automatic conversion tool. It is not
entirely robust. For example, if the C actions in the original grammar have
nested blocks, the tool will fail.

Annotated examples are in the "examples" subdirectory of the "parser-tools"
collection.
