4 Web Application Scheme

 #lang plai/web

The Web Application Scheme language allows you to write server-side Web
applications for the PLT Web Server.

For more information about writing Web applications, see: Web Applications in
Racket.

When you click on the Run button in DrRacket, your Web application is launched
in the Web server.

The application is available at http://localhost:8000/servlets/standalone.rkt.

The Web Application Scheme language will automatically load this URL in your
Web browser.

You may use no-web-browser to prevent the browser from being launched and
static-files-path to serve additional static files.

(start initial-request) → response?
  initial-request : request?
The initial request to a Web application is serviced by this procedure.
