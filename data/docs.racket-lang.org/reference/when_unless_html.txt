2.16 Guarded Evaluation: when and unless

            +Effects If...: when and unless in The Racket Guide introduces when
            and unless.

(when test-expr body ...+)
Evaluates test-expr. If the result is #f, then the result of the when
expression is #<void>. Otherwise, the bodys are evaluated, and the last body is
in tail position with respect to the when form.

Examples:

    > (when (positive? -5)
        (display "hi"))
    > (when (positive? 5)
        (display "hi")
        (display " there"))
    hi there



(unless test-expr body ...+)
Equivalent to (when (not test-expr) body ...+).

Examples:

    > (unless (positive? 5)
        (display "hi"))
    > (unless (positive? -5)
        (display "hi")
        (display " there"))
    hi there
