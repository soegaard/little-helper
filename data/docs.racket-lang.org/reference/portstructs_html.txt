12.1.8 Structures as Ports

prop:input-port : struct-type-property?
prop:output-port : struct-type-property?

The prop:input-port and prop:output-port structure type properties identify
structure types whose instances can serve as input and output ports,
respectively.

Each property value can be either of the following:

  • An input port (for prop:input-port) or output port (for prop:output-port):
    In this case, using the structure as port is equivalent to using the given
    input or output port.

  • An exact, non-negative integer between 0 (inclusive) and the number of
    non-automatic fields in the structure type (exclusive, not counting
    supertype fields): The integer identifies a field in the structure, and the
    field must be designated as immutable. If the field contains an input port
    (for prop:input-port) or output port (for prop:output-port), the port is
    used. Otherwise, an empty string input port is used for prop:input-port,
    and a port that discards all data is used for prop:output-port.

Some procedures, such as file-position, work on both input and output ports.
When given an instance of a structure type with both the prop:input-port and
prop:output-port properties, the instance is used as an input port.
