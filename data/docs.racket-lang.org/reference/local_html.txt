2.10 Local Definitions: local

 (require racket/local)
The bindings documented in this section are provided by the racket/local and
racket libraries, but not racket/base.

(local [definition ...] body ...+)
Like letrec, except that the bindings are expressed in the same way as in the
top-level or in a module body: using define, define-values, define-syntax,
struct, etc. Definitions are distinguished from non-definitions by partially
expanding definition forms (see Partial Expansion). As in the top-level or in a
module body, a begin-wrapped sequence is spliced into the sequence of
definitions.
