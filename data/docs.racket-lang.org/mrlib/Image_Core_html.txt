14 Image Core

 (require mrlib/image-core)

This library is the core part of the 2htdp/image library that DrRacket links
into the namespace of all languages that it runs. This ensures that minimal
support for these images are the same in all languages, specifically including
support for printing the images and constructing the core data structures
making up an image.

(render-image image dc dx dy) → void?
  image : image?
  dc : (is-a?/c dc<%>)
  dx : number?
  dy : number?
Draws image in dc at the position (dx,dy).

(image? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Recognizes the images that library handles.

(un/cache-image image b) → image?
  image : image?
  b : any/c
Returns an image that either caches its drawing in the snip draw method or
doesn’t, depending on b.

(compute-image-cache image) → void?
  image : image?
When the image has a bitmap-cache (which it does by default, although un/
cache-image can disable it), this function fills in the bitmap, doing the work
to draw image into the bitmap.

Ordinarily, the image’s bitmap cache is computed the first time the image is
actually rendered.
