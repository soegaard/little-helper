5 GIF and Animated GIF Writing

 (require mrlib/gif)

(write-gif bitmap filename) → void?
   bitmap   :   (or/c (is-a?/c bitmap%)
                      (-> (is-a?/c bitmap%)))
  filename : path-string
Writes the given bitmap to filename as a GIF image, where bitmap is either an
instance of bitmap% or a thunk (to be called just once) that generates such an
object. If the bitmap uses more than 256 colors, it is automatically quantized
using a simple algorithm; see quantize. If the bitmap has a mask bitmap via
get-loaded-mask, it is used to determine transparent pixels in the generated
GIF image.

 → void?
                 (and/c
   bitmaps   :     (listof (or/c (is-a?/c bitmap%)
                                 (-> (is-a?/c bitmap%))))
                   pair?)
  delay-csec : (integer-in 0 4294967295)
  filename : path-string
  loop? : any/c = (and delay-csec #t)
  one-at-a-time? : any/c = #f
   last-frame-delay   :   (or/c (integer-in 0 4294967295) false/c)
                      =   #f
Writes the bitmaps in bitmaps to filename as an animated GIF. The bitmaps list
can contain a mixture of bitmap% objects and thunks (each called just once)
that produce bitmap% objects. The delay-csec argument is the amount of time in
1/100s of a second to wait between transitions. If loop? is a true value, then
the GIF is marked as a looping animation.

If one-at-a-time? is #f, then the content of all images is collected and
quantized at once, to produce a single colortable; a drawback to this approach
is that it uses more memory, and it allows less color variation among animation
frames. Even when one-at-a-time? is #f, the result of each thunk in bitmaps is
converted to a byte-string one at a time.

If one-at-a-time? is true, then the bitmaps are quantized and written to the
file one at a time; that is, for each thunk in bitmaps, its result is written
and discarded before another thunk is called. A drawback to this approach is
that a separate colortable is written for each frame in the animation, which
can make the resulting file large.

If last-frame-delay is not false, a delay of last-frame-delay (in 1/100s of a
second) is added to the last frame. This extra delay is useful when loop? is
true.
