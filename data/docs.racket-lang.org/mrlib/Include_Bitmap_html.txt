8 Include Bitmap

 (require mrlib/include-bitmap)
The include-bitmap form takes a filename containing a bitmap and “inlines” the
bitmap into the program.

Historically, the advantage of inlining the bitmap is that a stand-alone
executable can be created that contains the bitmap and does not refer to the
original image file. The define-runtime-path form, however, now provides a
better alternative.

(include-bitmap path-spec)
(include-bitmap path-spec type-expr)

The path-spec is the same as for include form. The type-expr should produce
'unknown, 'unknown/mask, etc., as for bitmap%, and the default is 'unknown/
mask.

(include-bitmap/relative-to source path-spec)
(include-bitmap/relative-to source path-spec [type-expr])
Analogous to include-at/relative-to, though only a source is needed (no
context).
