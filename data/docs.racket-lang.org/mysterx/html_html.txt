3.4 HTML and Dynamic HTML

The mx-element% class encapsulates HTML elements. By calling the methods of the
class, you can change the appearance of elements, and place new HTML before or
after the element. While the methods are described here, a good DHTML
reference, such as Goodman’s Dynamic HTML will have more complete information.

Many of the mx-element% methods have two variants, a version that takes or
returns Racket data, and another -native version that takes or returns a
string. For methods that return values of element properties, we assume two
characteristics, which we do not mention in the methods’ documentation: 1)
Native methods return the empty string for properties that have not been set,
and 2) non-native methods raise an error for properties that have not been set.
