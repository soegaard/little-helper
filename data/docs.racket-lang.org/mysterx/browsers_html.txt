3.1 Browsers

mx-browser% : class?
  superclass: object%



    (new mx-browser%  [ [label label]                   
                        [width width]                   
                        [height height]                 
                        [x x]                           
                        [y y]]                          
                        [style-options style-options])  
     → (is-a?/c mx-browser%)
      label : string? = "MysterX"
       width   :   (or/c exact-nonnegative-integer? (one-of/c 'default))
               =   'default
       height   :   (or/c exact-nonnegative-integer? (one-of/c 'default))
                =   'default
      x : (or/c exact-integer? (one-of/c 'default)) = 'default
      y : (or/c exact-integer? (one-of/c 'default)) = 'default
       style-options   :   (listof (any-of/c 'iconize 'maximize 'no-system-menu
                                             'no-thick-border 'scrollbars))
    Creates an instance of a MysterX browser. The label argument is a string
    for the document caption, with default . The width, height, x, and y give
    the size and placement of the browser window on the desktop, with defaults
    provided by Windows. When style-options includes 'scrollbars, the vertical
    scrollbar is disabled if scrolling is unnecessary, and the horizontal
    scrollbar disappears if scrolling is unnecessary.

    Although the browser window cannot be hidden initially, it can be iconized.
    The restore method can be used to restore an iconized browser to an
    ordinary window.

    (send a-mx-browser current-document)
     → (is-a?/c mx-document<%>)
    Returns the current document in the browser.

    (send a-mx-browser print-document) → void?
    Prints the document displayed by the browser to the default printer. As an
    unintentional side-effect, the browser window is minimized.

    (send a-mx-browser show show?) → void?
      show? : any/c
    If show? is #f, the browser window is hidden. Otherwise, the window is
    shown.

    (send a-mx-browser navigate url) → string?
      url : string?
    Navigates the browser to the URL given by url. Any DHTML changes to the
    page associated with the URL are not shown. Returns a string that is the
    actual URL navigated to.

    (send a-mx-browser navigate/status url)
     → (list/c string? (or/c false/c integer? (one-of/c 'no-status)))
      url : string?
    Navigates the browser to the URL given by url. Any DHTML changes to the
    page associated with the URL are not shown. Returns a list, whose first
    element string that is the actual URL navigated to, and whose second
    element is a status code, one of: #f, indicating no status could be
    obtained; a number, such as 200 or 404, indicating the http status; or
    'no-status, indicating that url does not denote a URL with the “http”
    scheme.

    (send a-mx-browser go-back) → string?
    Navigates the browser back to a URL within its history list. Any DHTML
    changes to the page associated with the URL are not shown. Returns a string
    that is the actual URL navigated to.

    (send a-mx-browser go-forward) → string?
    Navigates the browser forward to a URL within its history list. Any DHTML
    changes to the page associated with the URL are not shown. Returns a string
    that is the actual URL navigated to.

    (send a-mx-browser refresh) → boolean?
    Refreshes the document in the browser. Returns #t if the refresh is
    successful, #f otherwise.

    (send a-mx-browser iconize) → void?

    (send a-mx-browser register-event-handler   elem        
                                                f)     →   void?
      elem : (is-a?/c mx-element%)
      f : ((is-a?/c mx-event<%>) . -> . any)
    Registers an event handler for the HTML element elem. The result of f is
    discarded.

    (send a-mx-browser unregister-event-handler elem) → void?
      elem : (is-a?/c mx-element%)
    Unregisters an event handler for an HTML element in the browser.

    Creates a thread to handle events using the registered event handlers.

    (send a-mx-browser stop-handling-events) → void?
    Kills the thread currently handling events for the browser.

Blocks until all browser windows have been closed or hidden, using the show
method of mx-browser%. This is useful when a MysterX program file is run as a
script, to prevent mzscheme or mred from closing prematurely.
