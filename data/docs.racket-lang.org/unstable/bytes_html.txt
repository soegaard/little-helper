This library is unstable; compatibility will not be maintained. See Unstable:
May Change Without Warning for more information.

(bytes-ci=? b1 b2) → boolean?
  b1 : bytes?
  b2 : bytes?
Compares two bytes case insensitively.

(read/bytes b) → serializable?
  b : bytes?
reads a value from b and returns it.

(write/bytes v) → bytes?
  v : serializable?
writes v to a bytes and returns it.
