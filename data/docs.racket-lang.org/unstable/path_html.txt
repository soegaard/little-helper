23 Path

 (require unstable/path)

This library is unstable; compatibility will not be maintained. See Unstable:
May Change Without Warning for more information.

(explode-path* p) → (listof path-element?)
  p : path-string?
Like normalize-path, but does not resolve symlinks.

(path-without-base base p) → (listof path-element?)
  base : path-string?
  p : path-string?
Returns, as a list, the portion of p after base, assuming base is a prefix of
p.

(directory-part p) → path?
  p : path-string?
Returns the directory part of p, returning (current-directory) if it is
relative.

(build-path-unless-absolute base p) → path?
  base : path-string?
  p : path-string?
Prepends base to p, unless p is absolute.

(strip-prefix-ups p) → (listof path-element?)
  p : (listof path-element?)
Removes all the prefix ".."s from p.
