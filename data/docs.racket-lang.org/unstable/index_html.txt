Unstable: May Change Without Warning

 (require unstable)

This manual documents some of the libraries available in the unstable
collection.

The name unstable is intended as a warning that the interfaces in particular
are unstable. Developers of planet packages and external projects should avoid
using modules in the unstable collection. Contracts may change, names may
change or disappear, even entire modules may move or disappear without warning
to the outside world.

Developers of unstable libraries must follow the guidelines in Guidelines for
developing unstable libraries.
