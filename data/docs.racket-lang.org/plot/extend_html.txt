3 Customizing Plots

 (require plot/extend)

The plot/extend module allows you to create your own constructors, further
customize the appearance of the plot windows, and in general extend the
package.

(sample-size sample-count x-min x-max) → real?
  sample-count : exact-positive-integer?
  x-min : number
  x-max : number
Given sample-count, x-min, and x-max, returns the size of each sample.

(scale-vectors   vecs                  
                 x-sample-size         
                 y-sample-size)   →   (listof vector?)
  vecs : (listof vector?)
  x-sample-size : real?
  y-sample-size : real?
Scales vectors, causing them to fit in their boxes.

(x-values sample-count x-min x-max) → (listof real?)
  sample-count : exact-positive-integer?
  x-min : number
  x-max : number
Given samples, x-min, and x-max, returns a list of xs spread across the range.

(normalize-vector   vec                   
                    x-sample-size         
                    y-sample-size)   →   vector?
  vec : vector?
  x-sample-size : real?
  y-sample-size : real?
Normalizes vec based on x-sample-size and y-sample-size.

(normalize-vectors   vecs                  
                     x-sample-size         
                     y-sample-size)   →   (listof vector?)
  vecs : (listof vector?)
  x-sample-size : real?
  y-sample-size : real?
Normalizes vecs based on x-sample-size and y-sample-size.

(make-column x ys) → (listof (vector/c real? real?))
  x : real?
  ys : (listof real?)
Given an x and a list of ys, produces a list of points pairing the x with each
of the ys.

(xy-list sample-count x-min x-max y-min y-max)
 → (listof (listof (vector/c real? real?)))
  sample-count : exact-positive-integer?
  x-min : real?
  x-max : real?
  y-min : real?
  y-max : real?
Makes a list of all the positions on the graph.

(zgrid f xs ys) → (listof (listof real?))
  f : (real? real? . -> . real?)
  xs : (listof real?)
  ys : (listof real?)
Given a function that consumes x and y to produce z, a list of xs, and a list
of ys, produces a list of z column values.

2d-view% : class?
  superclass: plot-view%

Provides an interface to drawing 2-D plots. An instance of 2d-view% is created
by plot, and the following methods can be used to adjust it.


    (send a-2d-view set-labels   x-label        
                                 y-label

      x-label : string?
      y-label : string?
      title : string?
    Sets the axis labels and title.
