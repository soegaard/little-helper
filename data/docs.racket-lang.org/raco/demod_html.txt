8 raco demod: Demodularizing Programs

The raco demod command takes a racket module and flattens all of its
dependencies into a single compiled module. A file "‹name›.rkt" is
demodularized into "‹name›_rkt_merged.zo".

The demodularized zo file can be run by passing it as an argument to the racket
command-line program.
