Chapter 2

Requirement levels

The key words “must”, “must not”, “should”, “should not”, “recommended”, “may”,
and “optional” in this report are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3
]. Specifically:

must
    This word means that a statement is an absolute requirement of the
    specification.
must not
    This phrase means that a statement is an absolute prohibition of the
    specification.
should
    This word, or the adjective “recommended”, means that valid reasons may
    exist in particular circumstances to ignore a statement, but that the
    implications must be understood and weighed before choosing a different
    course.
should not
    This phrase, or the phrase “not recommended”, means that valid reasons may
    exist in particular circumstances when the behavior of a statement is
    acceptable, but that the implications should be understood and weighed
    before choosing the course described by the statement.
may
    This word, or the adjective “optional”, means that an item is truly
    optional.

In particular, this report occasionally uses “should” to designate
circumstances that are outside the specification of this report, but cannot be
practically detected by an implementation; see section 5.4. In such
circumstances, a particular implementation may allow the programmer to ignore
the recommendation of the report and even exhibit reasonable behavior. However,
as the report does not specify the behavior, these programs may be unportable,
that is, their execution might produce different results on different
implementations.

Moreover, this report occasionally uses the phrase “not required” to note the
absence of an absolute requirement.
