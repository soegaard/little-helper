2.1 Simple Values

Racket values include numbers, booleans, strings, and byte strings. In DrRacket
and documentation examples (when you read the documentation in color), value
expressions are shown in green.

Numbers are written in the usual way, including fractions and imaginary
numbers:

            +Numbers (later in this guide) explains more about numbers.

    1       3.14
    1/2     6.02e+23
    1+2i    9999999999999999999999

Booleans are #t for true and #f for false. In conditionals, however, all non-#f
values are treated as true.

            +Booleans (later in this guide) explains more about booleans.

Strings are written between doublequotes. Within a string, backslash is an
escaping character; for example, a backslash followed by a doublequote includes
a literal doublequote in the string. Except for an unescaped doublequote or
backslash, any Unicode character can appear in a string constant.

            +Strings (Unicode) (later in this guide) explains more about
            strings.

    "Hello, world!"
    "Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel"
    "λx:(μα.α→α).xx"

When a constant is evaluated in the REPL, it typically prints the same as its
input syntax. In some cases, the printed form is a normalized version of the
input syntax. In documentation and in DrRacket’s REPL, results are printed in
blue instead of green to highlight the difference between an input expression
and a printed result.

Examples:

    > 1.0000
    1.0

    > "Bugs \u0022Figaro\u0022 Bunny"
    "Bugs \"Figaro\" Bunny"
