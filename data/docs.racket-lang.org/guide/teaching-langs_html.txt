22.3 Teaching

The How to Design Programs textbook relies on pedagogic variants of Racket that
smooth the introduction of programming concepts for new programmers. The
languages are documented in How to Design Programs Languages.

The How to Design Programs languages are typically not used with #lang
prefixes, but are instead used within DrRacket by selecting the language from
the Choose Language... dialog.
