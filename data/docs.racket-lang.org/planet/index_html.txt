PLaneT: Automatic Package Distribution

Jacob Matthews
and Robert Bruce Findler

The PLaneT system is a method for automatically sharing code packages, both as
libraries and as full applications, that gives every user of a PLaneT client
the illusion of having a local copy of every code package on the server. It
consists of the central PLaneT package repository, a server that holds all
PLaneT packages, and the PLaneT client, built into Racket, which transparently
interacts with the server on your behalf when necessary.
