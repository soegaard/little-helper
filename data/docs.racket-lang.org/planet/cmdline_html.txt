3 The raco planet Command-Line Tool

The raco planet command-line tool allows a command-line interface to the most
commonly-performed PLaneT tasks. It is invoked from the command line as

  raco planet subcommand arg ...

where subcommand is a subcommand from the following list, and arg is a sequence
of arguments determined by that subcommand:

  • create: create a PLaneT archive from a directory

  • install: download and install a given package

  • remove: remove the specified package from the local cache

  • show: list the packages installed in the local cache

  • clearlinks: clear the linkage table, allowing upgrades

  • fileinject: install a local file to the planet cache

  • link: create a development link

  • unlink: remove development link associated with the given package

  • fetch: download a package file without installing it

  • url: get a URL for the given package

  • open: unpack the contents of the given package

  • structure: display the structure of a given .plt archive

  • print: display a file within of the given .plt archive

Each of these commands is described in more detail below. All the functionality
of the command-line tool is also provided with a programmatic interface by the
"util.rkt" library.

3.1 create

Usage:
  raco planet create [ <option> ... ] <path>
Create a PLaneT archive in the current directory whose contents are the
directory <path>.

<option> is one of:

  • -f, --force: force a package to be created even if its info.rkt file
    contains errors.

3.2 install

Usage:
  raco planet install <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min>
Download and install the package that (require (planet "file.rkt" (<owner>
<pkg> <maj> <min>))) would install.

3.3 remove

Usage:
  raco planet remove [ <option> ... ] <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min>
Remove the specified package from the local cache, optionally also removing its
distribution file.

<option> is one of:

  • -e, --erase: also remove the package’s distribution file from the
    uninstalled-package cache

3.4 show

Usage:
  raco planet show [ <option> ... ]
List the packages installed in the local cache.

<option> is one of:

  • -p, --packages: show packages only (default)

  • -l, --linkage: show linkage table only

  • -a, --all: show packages and linkage

3.5 clearlinks

Usage:
  raco planet clearlinks
Clear the linkage table, allowing upgrades.

3.6 fileinject

Usage:
  raco planet fileinject <owner> <plt-file> <maj> <min>
Install local file <plt-file> into the planet cache as though it had been
downloaded from the planet server. It is treated as though it had the given
owner name as its owner name, the given file’s filename as the its package
name, and the given major and minor version numbers.

3.7 link

Usage:
  raco planet link <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min> <path>
Create a development link (see Development Links) between the given package
specifier and the specified directory name.

3.8 unlink

Usage:
  raco planet unlink [ <option> ] <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min>
Remove any development link (see Development Links) associated with the given
package.

<option> can only be:

  • -q, --quiet: don’t signal an error on nonexistent links

3.9 fetch

Usage:
  raco planet fetch <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min>
Download the given package file from the central PLaneT repository without
installing it.

3.10 url

Usage:
  raco planet url <owner> <pkg> <maj> <min>
Get a URL for the given package.

This is never necessary for normal use of planet, but may be helpful in some
circumstances for retrieving packages.

3.11 open

Usage:
  raco planet open <plt-file> <target>
Unpack the contents of the given package into the given directory without
installing.

This command is not necessary for normal use of planet. It is intended to allow
you to inspect package contents offline without needing to install the package.

3.12 structure

Usage:
  raco planet structure <plt-file>
Print the structure of the PLaneT archive named by <plt-file> to the standard
output port.

This command does not unpack or install the named .plt file.

3.13 print

Usage:
  raco planet print <plt-file> <path>

Print the contents of the file named by <path>, which must be a relative path
within the PLaneT archive named by <plt-file>, to the standard output port.

This command does not unpack or install the named .plt file.
