8 Check Syntax

Check Syntax is a part of the DrRacket collection, but is implemented via the
tools API.

 (require drracket/syncheck-drracket-button)

                             (list/c
                              string?
syncheck-drracket-button  :   (is-a?/c bitmap%)
                              (-> (is-a?/c
                                   top-level-window<%>)
                                  any))
This is meant to be used with the 'drscheme:toolbar-buttons argument to the
info proc returned from read-language.

syncheck:button-callback
This is defined with define-local-member-name and is bound to a method of no
arguments of the DrRacket frame that runs Check Syntax.

syncheck-bitmap : (is-a?/c bitmap%)
The bitmap in the Check Syntax button on the DrRacket frame.
