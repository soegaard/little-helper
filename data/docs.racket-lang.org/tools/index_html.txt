Extending DrRacket

Robert Bruce Findler

;; indexing missing

 (require drracket/tool-lib)
 (require drscheme/tool-lib)

This manual describes DrRacket’s plugins interface. It assumes familiarity with
Racket, as described in the The Racket Guide, and the The Racket Reference,
DrRacket, as described in DrRacket: The Racket Programming Environment, and the
GUI library, as described in The Racket Graphical Interface Toolkit. The
Framework, as described in Framework: Racket GUI Application Framework, may
also come in handy.

The drscheme/tool-lib library is for backward compatibility; it exports all of
the bindings of drracket/tool-lib.
