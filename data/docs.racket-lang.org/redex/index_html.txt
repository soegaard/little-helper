Redex: Practical Semantics Engineering

Robert Bruce Findler
and Casey Klein

PLT Redex consists of a domain-specific language for specifying reduction
semantics, plus a suite of tools for working with the semantics.

This is a reference manual for Redex. See http://redex.racket-lang.org/ for a
gentler overview. (See also the examples subdirectory in the redex collection.)

To load Redex use:
 (require redex)
which provides all of the names documented in this library.

Alternatively, use the redex/reduction-semantics and redex/pict modules, which
provide only non-GUI functionality (i.e., everything except redex/gui), making
them suitable for programs which should not depend on racket/gui/base.
