3.1 Type Constructors

(make-ctype type scheme-to-c c-to-scheme) → ctype?
  type : ctype?
  scheme-to-c : (or/c #f (any/c . -> . any))
  c-to-scheme : (or/c #f (any/c . -> . any))
Creates a new C type value whose representation for foreign code is the same as
type’s. The given conversions functions convert to and from the Racket
representation of type. Either conversion function can be #f, meaning that the
conversion for the corresponding direction is the identity function. If both
functions are #f, type is returned.

(ctype? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v is a C type, #f otherwise.

(ctype-sizeof type) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
  type : ctype?
(ctype-alignof type) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
  type : ctype?
Returns the size or alignment of a given type for the current platform.

(ctype->layout type)
 → (flat-rec-contract rep symbol? (listof rep))
  type : ctype?
Returns a value to describe the eventual C representation of the type. It can
be any of the following symbols:

    'int8 'uint8 'int16 'uint16 'int32 'uint32 'int64 'uint64
    'float 'double 'bool 'void 'pointer 'fpointer
    'bytes 'string/ucs-4 'string/utf-16

The result can also be a list, which describes a C struct whose element
representations are provided in order within the list.

(compiler-sizeof sym) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
  sym : symbol?
Possible values for symbol are 'int, 'char, 'short, 'long, '*, 'void, 'float,
'double. The result is the size of the correspond type according to the C
sizeof operator for the current platform. The compiler-sizeof operation should
be used to gather information about the current platform, such as defining
alias type like _int to a known type like _int32.
