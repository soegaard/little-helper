1 Running R5RS Programs

Racket provides several layers of support for programs written according to
R5RS:

  • DrRacket provides an R5RS language, which can be selected via the Language|
    Choose Language... menu item. See Choosing a Language in DrRacket: The
    Racket Programming Environment for more information.

  • The plt-r5rs executable runs an R5RS program or provides a read-eval-print
    loop for evaluating R5RS expressions and definitions. See plt-r5rs (later
    in this manual) for more information.

  • The r5rs library implemented R5RS procedures and syntactic forms. It can
    also be used with #lang to create a module whose body is implemented in an
    R5RS-like language. See R5RS Module Language (later in this manual) for
    more information.

  • The r5rs/init library extends r5rs to set parameters (such as
    case-insensitive symbol reading) for R5RS loading or an R5RS
    read-eval-print loop. See R5RS Initialization Library (later in this
    manual) for more information.
