R5RS: Legacy Scheme

The The Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme defines a dialect of
Scheme. We use R5RS to refer to both the standard and the language defined by
the standard.

            See Dialects of Racket and Scheme for general information about
            different dialects of Scheme within Racket.

The default dialect of Lisp provided by racket and other Racket tools differs
from R5RS in many ways, but Racket includes tools and libraries for running
R5RS programs.
