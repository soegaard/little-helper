toggle-button-snip% : class?
  superclass: snip%

A check-box%-like control that a user can toggle between checked and unchecked
states.

(new toggle-button-snip%    [images-off images-off]  
                            [images-on images-on]    
                            [turn-on turn-on]        
                            [turn-off turn-off]      
                          [ [state state]])          
 → (is-a?/c toggle-button-snip%)
  images-off : (cons/c path-string? path-string?)
  images-on : (cons/c path-string? path-string?)
  turn-on : ((is-a?/c toggle-button-snip%) (is-a?/c event%) . -> . void?)
  turn-off : ((is-a?/c toggle-button-snip%) (is-a?/c event%) . -> . void?)
  state : (symbols 'on 'off) = 'on
The images-off argument is a pair filenames to be load as the button-label
image, where the first is the image for when the button is at rest, and the
second is the image for the button while its pressed—in both cases when the
button is not checked by the user. The images-on argument similarly determines
the images for then the button is checked.

The turn-on and turn-off callbacks are invoked when the button changes to
checked or unchecked, respectively.

The state argument determines whether the button is initially checked.
