Getting Started with Racket

If you are new to programming or if you have the patience to work through a
textbook:

  • How to Design Programs is the best place to start. Whenever the book says
    “Scheme,” you can read it as “Racket.”

  • Continue: Web Applications in Racket introduces you to modules and building
    web applications.

  • The Racket Guide describes the rest of the Racket language, which is much
    bigger than the learning-oriented languages of the textbook. Since you
    learned functional programming from the textbook, you’ll be able to skim
    chapters 1 and 2 of the Guide.

If you’re already a programmer and you’re in more of a hurry:

  • Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures gives you a taste of Racket.

  • More: Systems Programming with Racket dives much deeper and much faster. If
    it’s too much, just skip to the Guide.

  • The Racket Guide starts with a tutorial on Racket basics, and then it
    describes the rest of the Racket language.

Of course, you should feel free to mix and match the above two tracks, since
there is information in each that is not in the other.
