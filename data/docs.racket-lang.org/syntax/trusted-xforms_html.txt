6 Trusting Standard Recertifying Transformers

 (require syntax/trusted-xforms)

The syntax/trusted-xforms library has no exports. It exists only to require
other modules that perform syntax transformations, where the other
transformations must use syntax-recertify. An application that wishes to
provide a less powerful code inspector to a sub-program should generally attach
syntax/trusted-xforms to the sub-program’s namespace so that things like the
class system from scheme/class work properly.
