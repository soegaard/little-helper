18 SSL Unit: tcp^ via SSL

 (require net/ssl-tcp-unit)
The net/ssl-tcp-unit library provides a function for creating a tcp^
implementation with openssl functionality.

(make-ssl-tcp@   server-cert-file                
                 server-key-file                 
                 server-root-cert-files          
                 server-suggest-auth-file        
                 client-cert-file                
                 client-key-file                 
                 client-root-cert-files)    →   unit?
  server-cert-file : (or/c path-string? false/c)
  server-key-file : (or/c path-string? false/c)
  server-root-cert-files : (or/c (listof path-string?) false/c)
  server-suggest-auth-file : path-string?
  client-cert-file : (or/c path-string? false/c)
  client-key-file : (or/c path-string? false/c)
  client-root-cert-files : (listof path-string?)
Returns a unit that implements tcp^ using the SSL functions from openssl. The
arguments to make-ssl-tcp@ control the certificates and keys uses by server and
client connections:

  • server-cert-file — a PEM file for a server’s certificate; #f means no
    certificate (which is unlikely to work with any SSL client)

  • server-key-file — a private key PEM to go with server-cert-file; #f means
    no key (which is likely renders a certificate useless)

  • server-root-cert-files — a list of PEM files for trusted root certificates;
    #f disables verification of peer client certificates

  • server-suggest-auth-file — PEM file for root certificates to be suggested
    to peer clients that must supply certificates

  • client-cert-file — a PEM file for a client’s certificate; #f means no
    certificate (which is usually fine)

  • client-key-file — a private key PEM to go with client-cert-file; #f means
    no key (which is likely renders a certificate useless)

  • client-root-cert-files — a list of PEM files for trusted root certificates;
    #f disables verification of peer server certificates
