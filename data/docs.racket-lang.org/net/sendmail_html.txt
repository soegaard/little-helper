7 sendmail: Sending E-Mail

 (require net/sendmail)
The net/sendmail module provides tools for sending electronic mail messages
using a sendmail program on the local system. See also the net/smtp package,
which sends mail via SMTP.

All strings used in mail messages are assumed to conform to their corresponding
SMTP specifications, except as noted otherwise.

7.1 Sendmail Functions

(send-mail-message/port   from                     
                          subject                  
                          to                       
                          cc                       
                          bcc                      
                          extra-header ...)   →   output-port?
  from : string?
  subject : string?
  to : (listof string?)
  cc : (listof string?)
  bcc : (listof string?)
  extra-header : string?
The first argument is the header for the sender, the second is the subject
line, the third a list of “To:” recipients, the fourth a list of “CC:”
recipients, and the fifth a list of “BCC:” recipients. Additional arguments
argument supply other mail headers, which must be provided as lines (not
terminated by a linefeed or carriage return) to include verbatim in the header.

The return value is an output port into which the client must write the
message. Clients are urged to use close-output-port on the return value as soon
as the necessary text has been written, so that the sendmail process can
complete.

The from argument can be any value; of course, spoofing should be used with
care.

(send-mail-message   from                     
                     subject                  
                     to                       
                     cc                       
                     bcc                      
                     body                     
                     extra-header ...)   →   void?
  from : string?
  subject : string?
  to : (listof string?)
  cc : (listof string?)
  bcc : (listof string?)
  body : (listof string?)
  extra-header : string?
Like send-mail-message/port, but with body as a list of strings, each providing
a line of the message body.

Lines that contain a single period do not need to be quoted.

(struct   no-mail-recipients exn ()
          #:extra-constructor-name make-no-mail-recipients)
Raised when no mail recipients were specified for send-mail-message/port.

7.2 Sendmail Unit

 (require net/sendmail-unit)

sendmail@ : unit?
Imports nothing, exports sendmail^.

7.3 Sendmail Signature

 (require net/sendmail-sig)

sendmail^ : signature

Includes everything exported by the net/sendmail module.
