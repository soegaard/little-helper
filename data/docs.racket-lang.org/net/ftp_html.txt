4 FTP: Client Downloading

 (require net/ftp)
The net/ftp library provides utilities for FTP client operations.
The library was written by Micah Flatt.

4.1 Functions

(ftp-connection? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v represents an FTP connection as returned by
ftp-establish-connection, #f otherwise.

(ftp-establish-connection   server         
                            port-no        
                            user           
                            passwd)   →   ftp-connection?
  server : string?
  port-no : (integer-in 0 65535)
  user : string?
  passwd : string?
Establishes an FTP connection with the given server using the supplied username
and password.

The username and password strings are encoded to bytes using the current
locale’s encoding.

(ftp-close-connection ftp-conn) → void?
  ftp-conn : ftp-connection?
Closes an FTP connection.

(ftp-cd ftp-conn new-dir) → void?
  ftp-conn : ftp-connection?
  new-dir : string?
Changes the current directory on the FTP server to new-dir. The new-dir
argument is not interpreted at all, but simply passed on to the server (encoded
using the current locale’s encoding); it must not contain a newline.

(ftp-directory-list ftp-conn)
      (listof (list/c (one-of/c "-" "d" "l")
  →                   string?
                      string?))
  ftp-conn : ftp-connection?
Returns a list of files and directories in the current directory of the server,
assuming that the server provides directory information in the quasi-standard
Unix format.

Each file or directory is represented by a list of three strings. The first
string is either "-", "d", or "l", depending on whether the items is a file,
directory, or link, respectively. The second item is the file’s date; to
convert this value to seconds consistent with file-seconds, pass the date
string to ftp-make-file-seconds, below. The third string is the name of the
file or directory.

All strings are decoded from bytes using the current locale’s encoding.

(ftp-make-file-seconds ftp-date) → exact-integer?
  ftp-date : string?
Takes a date string produced by ftp-directory-list and converts it to seconds
(which can be used with seconds->date).

(ftp-download-file ftp-conn local-dir file) → void?
  ftp-conn : ftp-connection?
  local-dir : path-string?
  file : string?
Downloads file from the server’s current directory and puts it in local-dir
using the same name. If the file already exists in the local directory, it is
replaced, but only after the transfer succeeds (i.e., the file is first
downloaded to a temporary file, then moved into place on success).

4.2 FTP Unit

 (require net/ftp-unit)

ftp@ : unit?
Imports nothing, exports ftp^.

4.3 FTP Signature

 (require net/ftp-sig)

ftp^ : signature

Includes everything exported by the net/ftp module.
