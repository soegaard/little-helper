17 TCP Redirect: tcp^ via Channels

 (require net/tcp-redirect)
The net/tcp-redirect library provides a function for directing some TCP port
numbers to use buffered channels instead of the TCP support from racket/tcp.

(tcp-redirect port-numbers) → unit?
  port-numbers : (listof (integer-in 0 65535))
Returns a unit that implements tcp^. For port numbers not listed in
port-numbers, the unit’s implementations are the racket/tcp implementations.

For the port numbers listed in port-numbers and for connections to "127.0.0.1",
the unit’s implementation does not use TCP connections, but instead uses
internal buffered channels. Such channels behave exactly as TCP listeners and
ports.
