15 Group

group:% : class?
  superclass: object%

This class manages a group of frames matching the frame:basic<%> interface.
There is one instance created by the framework, returned by the function
group:get-the-frame-group and every frame that was constructed with
frame:basic-mixin adds itself to the result of group:get-the-frame-group.


    (send a-group: set-open-here-frame frame) → void?
      frame : (is-a?/c frame:editor%)
    Sets the frame to load new files into. See also frame:open-here<%>.

    (send a-group: get-open-here-frame)
     → (or/c false/c (is-a?/c frame:editor<%>))
    Returns the currently saved frame to load new files into.

    (send a-group: get-mdi-parent)
     → (or/c false/c (is-a?/c frame%))
    The result of this method must be used as the parent frame for each frame
    in the group.

    (send a-group: get-frames)
     → (list-of (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>))
    Returns the frames in the group.

    (send a-group: frame-label-changed frame) → void?
      frame : (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>)
    This method is called by frames constructed with frame:basic-mixin when
    their titles change.

    Updates the windows menu of each frame in the group.

    (send a-group: frame-shown/hidden) → void?
    This method is called by instances of frame:basic% to notify the frame
    group that a frame’s visibility is changed.

    Updates the Windows menus of all of the frames in the frame group.

    (send a-group: for-each-frame f) → void?
      f : ((is-a?/c frame:basic<%>) -> void?)
    This method applies a function to each frame in the group. It also
    remembers the function and applies it to any new frames that are added to
    the group when they are added.

    See also get-frames.

    Applies f to each frame in the group

    (send a-group: get-active-frame) → (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>)
    Returns the frame with the keyboard focus or the first frame in the group.

    (send a-group: set-active-frame frame) → void?
      frame : (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>)
    Sets the active frame in the group. This method is called by on-activate.

    (send a-group: insert-frame frame) → void?
      frame : (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>)
    Inserts a frame into the group.

    (send a-group: remove-frame frame) → void?
      frame : (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>)
    Removes a frame from the group.

    (send a-group: clear) → boolean?
    This removes all of the frames in the group. It does not close the frames.
    See also on-close-alland can-close-all?.

    (send a-group: on-close-all) → void?
    Call this method to close all of the frames in the group. The function
    can-close-all? must have been called just before this function and it must
    have returned #t.

    Calls the on-close method and the show method (with #f as argument) on each
    frame in the group.

    (send a-group: can-close-all?) → boolean?
    Call this method to make sure that closing all of the frames in the frame
    groups is permitted by the user. The function on-close-all is expected to
    be called just after this method is called.

    Calls the can-close? method of each frame in the group.
    (send a-group: locate-file name)
     → (or/c false/c (is-a?/c frame:basic<%>))
      name : path?
    Returns the frame that is editing or viewing the file name.

(group:get-the-frame-group) → (is-a?/c group:%)
This returns the frame group.
(group:on-close-action) → void?
See also group:can-close-check.

Call this function from the can-close? callback of a frame in order for the
group to properly close the application.
(group:can-close-check) → boolean?
See also group:on-close-action.

Call this function from the can-close? callback of a frame in order for the
group to properly close the application.
(group:add-to-windows-menu proc) → any
  proc : (-> (is-a?/c menu%) any)
Procedures passed to this function are called when the Windows menu is created.
Use it to add additional menu items.
