3 Autosave

autosave:autosavable<%> : interface?
Classes that implement this interface can be autosaved.


    (send an-autosave:autosavable do-autosave) → void?
    This method is called when the object is registered to be autosaved (see
    autosave:register).

(autosave:register obj) → void?
   obj   :   (and/c (is-a?/c autosave:autosavable<%>)
                    (is-a?/c editor<%>))
Adds obj to the list of objects to be autosaved. When it is time to autosave,
the do-autosave method of the object is called. This method is responsible for
performing the autosave.

There is no need to de-register an object because the autosaver keeps a “weak”
pointer to the object; i.e., the autosaver does not keep an object from garbage
collection.
(autosave:restore-autosave-files/gui) → void?
Opens a GUI to ask the user about recovering any autosave files left around
from crashes and things.

This function doesn’t return until the user has finished restoring the autosave
files. (It uses yield to handle events however.)
