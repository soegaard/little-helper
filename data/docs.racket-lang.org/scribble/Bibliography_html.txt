4.3.10 Bibliography

            See also scriblib/autobib.

(cite key ...+) → element?
  key : string?
Links to a bibliography entry, using the keys both to indicate the bibliography
entry and, in square brackets, as the link text.

(bibliography [#:tag tag] entry ...) → part?
  tag : string? = "doc-bibliography"
  entry : bib-entry?
Creates a bibliography part containing the given entries, each of which is
created with bib-entry. The entries are typeset in order as given.

(bib-entry    #:key key                  
              #:title title              
            [ #:is-book? is-book?        
              #:author author            
              #:location location        
              #:date date                
              #:url url])           →   bib-entry?
  key : string?
  title : (or/c #f pre-content?)
  is-book? : boolean? = #f
  author : (or/c #f pre-content?) = #f
  location : (or/c #f pre-content?) = #f
  date : (or/c #f pre-content?) = #f
  url : (or/c #f pre-content?) = #f
Creates a bibliography entry. The key is used to refer to the entry via cite.
The other arguments are used as elements in the entry:

  • title is the title of the cited work. It will be surrounded by quotes in
    typeset form if is-book? is #f, otherwise it is typeset via italic.

  • author lists the authors. Use names in their usual order (as opposed to
    “last, first”), and separate multiple names with commas using “and” before
    the last name (where there are multiple names). The author is typeset in
    the bibliography as given, or it is omitted if given as #f.

  • location names the publication venue, such as a conference name or a
    journal with volume, number, and pages. The location is typeset in the
    bibliography as given, or it is omitted if given as #f.

  • date is a date, usually just a year (as a string). It is typeset in the
    bibliography as given, or it is omitted if given as #f.

  • url is an optional URL. It is typeset in the bibliography using tt and
    hyperlinked, or it is omitted if given as #f.

(bib-entry? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v is a bibliography entry created by bib-entry, #f otherwise.
