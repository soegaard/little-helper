7.6 Document Language

 #lang scribble/doclang
The scribble/doclang language provides everything from racket/base, except that
it replaces the #%module-begin form.

The scribble/doclang #%module-begin essentially packages the body of the module
into a call to decode, binds the result to doc, and exports doc.

Any module-level form other than an expression (e.g., a require or define)
remains at the top level, and the doc binding is put at the end of the module.
As usual, a module-top-level begin slices into the module top level.
