4.3.11 Miscellaneous

(t pre-content ...) → paragraph?
  pre-content : pre-content?
Wraps the decoded pre-content as a paragraph.

etc : element?
Like "etc.", but with an abbreviation-ending period for use in the middle of a
sentence.

PLaneT : element?
"PLaneT" (to help make sure you get the letters in the right case).

(hash-lang) → element?
Returns an element for #lang that is hyperlinked to an explanation.

void-const : element?
Returns an element for #<void>.

undefined-const : element?
Returns an element for #<undefined>.

(commandline pre-content ...) → paragraph?
  pre-content : pre-content?
Produces an inset command-line example (e.g., in typewriter font).

(centerline pre-flow ...) → nested-flow?
  pre-flow : pre-flow?
An alias for centered for backward compatibility.

(math pre-content ...) → element?
  pre-content : any/c
The decoded pre-content is further transformed:

  • Any immediate 'rsquo is converted to 'prime.

  • Parentheses and sequences of decimal digits in immediate strings are left
    as-is, but any other immediate string is italicized.

  • When _ appears before a non-empty sequence of numbers and letters, the
    sequence is typeset as a subscript.

  • When ^ appears before a non-empty sequence of numbers and letters, the
    sequence is typeset as a superscript.

(filebox filename pre-flow ...) → block?
  filename : (or/c string? element?)
  pre-flow : pre-flow?
Typesets the pre-flows as the content of filename. For example, the content may
be inset on the page with filename above it. If filename is a string, it is
passed to "filepath" to obtain an element.
