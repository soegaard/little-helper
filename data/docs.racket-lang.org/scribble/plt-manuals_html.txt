4 Scribbling Documentation

The scribble/manual language and associated libraries provide extensive support
for documenting Racket libraries. The most significant aspect of support for
documentation is the way that source-code bindings are connected to
documentation sites through the module namespace—a connection that is
facilitated by the fact that Scribble documents are themselves modules that
reside in the same namespace. Getting Started with Documentation provides an
introduction to using Scribble for documentation, and the remaining sections
document the relevant libraries and APIs in detail.
