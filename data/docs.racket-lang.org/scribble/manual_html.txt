4.3 Manual Forms

 #lang scribble/manual
The scribble/manual language provides all of scribble/base plus many additional
functions that are specific to writing Racket documentation.
The scribble/manual name can also be used as a library with require, in which
case it provides all of the same bindings, but without setting the reader or
setting the default rendering format to the Racket manual format.

With #lang, scribble/manual associates a latex-defaults style property with its
doc export to select the default Racket manual style for Latex rendering—unless
a style is supplied to title that already includes a latex-defaults style
property.
