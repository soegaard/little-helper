3.3 SIGPLAN Paper Format

 #lang scribble/sigplan
The scribble/sigplan language is like scribble/manual, but configured with
Latex style defaults to use the "sigplanconf.cls" class file that is included
with Scribble.

preprint
Enables the preprint option. Use preprint only on the same line as #lang, with
only whitespace (or other options) between scribble/sigplan and preprint:

  #lang scribble/sigplan @preprint


10pt
Enables the 10pt option. Use 10pt only on the same line as #lang, with only
whitespace (or other options) between scribble/sigplan and 10pt:

  #lang scribble/sigplan @10pt


nocopyright
Enables the nocopyright option. Use nocopyright only on the same line as #lang,
with only whitespace (or other options) between scribble/sigplan and
nocopyright:

  #lang scribble/sigplan @nocopyright


onecolumn
Enables the onecolumn option. Use onecolumn only on the same line as #lang,
with only whitespace (or other options) between scribble/sigplan and onecolumn:

    #lang scribble/sigplan @onecolumn

notimes
Disables the use of \usepackage{times} in the generated LaTeX output. Use
onecolumn only on the same line as #lang, with only whitespace (or other
options) between scribble/sigplan and notimes:

    #lang scribble/sigplan @notimes

noqcourier
Disables the use of \usepackage{qcourier} in the generated LaTeX output. Use
onecolumn only on the same line as #lang, with only whitespace (or other
options) between scribble/sigplan and noqcourier:

    #lang scribble/sigplan @noqcourier

The 10pt, preprint, nocopyright, onecolumn, notimes, and noqcourier options can
be used together and may appear in any order.
