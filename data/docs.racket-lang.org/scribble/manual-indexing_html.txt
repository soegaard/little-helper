4.3.8 Indexing

See also Indexing.

(indexed-racket datum ...)
A combination of racket and as-index, with the following special cases when a
single datum is provided:

  • If datum is a quote form, then the quote is removed from the key (so that
    it’s sorted using its unquoted form).

  • If datum is a string, then quotes are removed from the key (so that it’s
    sorted using the string content).

(indexed-scheme datum ...)
Compatibility alias for indexed-racket.

(idefterm pre-content ...) → element?
  pre-content : pre-content?
Combines as-index and defterm. The content normally should be plural, rather
than singular. Consider using deftech, instead, which always indexes.

(pidefterm pre-content ...) → element?
  pre-content : pre-content?
Like idefterm, but plural: adds an “s” on the end of the content for the index
entry. Consider using deftech, instead.

(indexed-file pre-content ...) → element?
  pre-content : pre-content?
A combination of file and as-index, but where the sort key for the index iterm
does not include quotes.

(indexed-envvar pre-content ...) → element?
  pre-content : pre-content?
A combination of envvar and as-index.
