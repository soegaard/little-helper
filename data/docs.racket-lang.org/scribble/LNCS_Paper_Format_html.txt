3.5 LNCS Paper Format

 #lang scribble/lncs
The scribble/lncs language is like scribble/manual, but configured with Latex
style defaults to use the "llncs.cls" class file.
The class file must be downloaded from Springer and installed into the scribble
/lncs collection directory. (Run a module in the language scribble/lncs to
learn the precise paths where the file may go.)

(abstract pre-content ...) → block?
  pre-content : pre-content?
Generates a nested flow for a paper abstract.

(include-abstract module-path)
Similar to include-section, but incorporates the document in the specified
module as an abstract. The document must have no title or sub-parts.

(authors auth ...)
 
auth   =   (author pre-content-expr ...)
       |   (author #:inst str-expr pre-content-expr ...)
 
       pre-content-expr   :   pre-content?
       str-expr    :   string?

A replacement for author from scribble/base.

The #:inst should be a number that matches up to one of the arguments to
institutes.

(institutes (institute pre-content-expr ...) ...)
 
   pre-content-expr   :   pre-content?
The pre-content-exprs are used as the institutions of the authors.

institute
For use only in institutes.

(email pre-content-expr ...)
Specifies an email address; must be used inside institute.
