string-snip% : class?
  superclass: snip%

An instance of string-snip% is created automatically when text is inserted into
a text editor. See also on-new-string-snip in text%.

(make-object string-snip% [allocsize]) → (is-a?/c string-snip%)
  allocsize : exact-nonnegative-integer? = 0
(make-object string-snip% s) → (is-a?/c string-snip%)
  s : string?
Creates a string snip whose initial content is s, if supplied, empty otherwise.
In the latter case, the optional allocsize argument is a hint about how much
storage space for text should be initially allocated by the snip.

(send a-string-snip insert s len [pos]) → void?
  s : string?
  len : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  pos : exact-nonnegative-integer? = 0
Inserts s (with length len) into the snip at relative position pos within the
snip.

(send a-string-snip read len f) → void?
  len : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  f : (is-a?/c editor-stream-in%)
Reads the snip’s data from the given stream.

The len argument specifies the maximum length of the text to be read. (When a
text snip is written to a file, the very first field is the length of the text
contained in the snip.) This method is usually invoked by the text snip class’s
read method.
