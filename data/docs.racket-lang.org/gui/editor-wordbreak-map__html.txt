editor-wordbreak-map% : class?
  superclass: object%

An editor-wordbreak-map% objects is used with a text% objects to specify
word-breaking criteria for the default wordbreaking function. See also
set-wordbreak-map, get-wordbreak-map, find-wordbreak, and set-wordbreak-func.

A global object the-editor-wordbreak-map is created automatically and used as
the default map for all text% objects.

A wordbreak objects implements a mapping from each character to a list of
symbols. The following symbols are legal elements of the list:

  • 'caret

  • 'line

  • 'selection

  • 'user1

  • 'user2

The presence of a flag in a character’s value indicates that the character does
not break a word when searching for breaks using the corresponding reason. For
example, if 'caret is present, then the character is a non-breaking character
for caret-movement words. (Each stream of non-breaking characters is a single
word.)

(new editor-wordbreak-map%) → (is-a?/c editor-wordbreak-map%)
All ASCII alpha-numeric characters are initialized with '(caret line
selection). All other ASCII non-whitespace characters except - are initialized
with '(line). All ASCII whitespace characters and - are initialized with null.

(send an-editor-wordbreak-map get-map char)
 → (listof (one-of/c 'caret 'line 'selection 'user1 'user2))
  char : char?
Gets the mapping value for char. See editor-wordbreak-map% for more
information.

(send an-editor-wordbreak-map set-map   char          
                                        value)   →   void?
  char : char?
  value : (listof (one-of/c 'caret 'line 'selection 'user1 'user2))

Sets the mapping value for char to value. See editor-wordbreak-map% for more
information.
