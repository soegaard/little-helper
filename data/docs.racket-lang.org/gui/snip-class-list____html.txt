snip-class-list<%> : interface?
Each eventspace has its own instance of snip-class-list<%>, obtained with (
get-the-snip-class-list). New instances cannot be created directly. Each
instance keeps a list of snip classes. This list is needed for loading snips
from a file. See also Snip Classes.

(send a-snip-class-list add snipclass) → void?
  snipclass : (is-a?/c snip-class%)
Adds a snip class to the list. If a class with the same name already exists in
the list, this one will not be added.

(send a-snip-class-list find name)
 → (or/c (is-a?/c snip-class%) false/c)
  name : string?
Finds a snip class from the list with the given name, returning #f if none is
found.

(send a-snip-class-list find-position class)
 → exact-nonnegative-integer?
  class : (is-a?/c snip-class%)
Returns an index into the list for the specified class.

(send a-snip-class-list nth n)
 → (or/c (is-a?/c snip-class%) false/c)
  n : exact-nonnegative-integer?
Returns the nth class in the list, or #f if the list has n classes or less.

(send a-snip-class-list number) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
