The Racket Graphical Interface Toolkit

Matthew Flatt,
Robert Bruce Findler,
and John Clements

 (require racket/gui/base)
The racket/gui/base library provides all of the class, interface, and procedure
bindings defined in this manual, in addition to the bindings of racket/draw and
file/resource.

 #lang racket/gui
The racket/gui language combines all bindings of the racket language and the
racket/gui/base and racket/draw modules.

The racket/gui toolbox is roughly organized into two parts:

  • The windowing toolbox, for implementing windows, buttons, menus, text
    fields, and other controls.

  • The editor toolbox, for developing traditional text editors, editors that
    mix text and graphics, or free-form layout editors (such as a word
    processor, HTML editor, or icon-based file browser).

Both parts of the toolbox rely extensively on the racket/draw drawing library.
