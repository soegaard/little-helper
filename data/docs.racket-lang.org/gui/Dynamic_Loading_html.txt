10 Dynamic Loading

 (require racket/gui/dynamic)
The racket/gui/dynamic library provides functions for dynamically accessing the
racket/gui/base library, instead of directly requiring racket/gui or racket/gui
/base.

(gui-available?) → boolean?
Returns #t if dynamic access to the GUI bindings is available. The bindings are
available if racket/gui/base has been loaded, instantiated, and attached to the
namespace in which racket/gui/dynamic was instantiated.

(gui-dynamic-require sym) → any
  sym : symbol?
Like dynamic-require, but specifically to access exports of racket/gui/base.
