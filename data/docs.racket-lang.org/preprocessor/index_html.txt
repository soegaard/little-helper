mzpp and mztext: Preprocessors

Eli Barzilay

The "preprocessor" collection defines two Racket-based preprocessors for texts
that can have embedded Racket code. The two processors share a few features,
like several command-line flags and the fact that embedded Racket code is
case-sensitive by default.

Note that these processors are not intended as preprocessors for Racket code,
since you have macros to do that.
