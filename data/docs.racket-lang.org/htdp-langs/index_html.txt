How to Design Programs Languages

The languages documented in this manual are provided by DrRacket to be used
with the How to Design Programs book.

When programs in these languages are run in DrRacket, any part of the program
that was not run is highlighted in orange and black. These colors are intended
to give the programmer feedback about the parts of the program that have not
been tested. To avoid seeing these colors, use check-expect to test your
program. Of course, just because you see no colors, does not mean that your
program has been fully tested; it simply means that each part of the program
has been run (at least once).
