1.4 [blackjack] Blackjack — 21 Card Game

            To play Blackjack, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s
            called plt-games).

Standard Blackjack rules with the following specifics:

  • 1 player (not counting the dealer).

  • 4 decks, reshuffled after 3/4 of the cards are used.

  • Dealer stands on soft 17s.

  • Splitting is allowed only on the first two cards, and only if they are
    equal. 10 and the face cards are all considered equal for splitting.

  • Doubling is allowed on all unsplit hands, not on split hands.

  • No blackjacks after splitting.

  • No surrender.

  • No insurance.

  • No maximum under-21 hand size.

  • Dealer’s second card is not revealed if the player busts (or both halves of
    a split hand bust).
