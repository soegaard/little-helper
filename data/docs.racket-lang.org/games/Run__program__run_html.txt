1.18.10 Run, program, run

This section contains expressions that start the Chat Noir game going.

First, here is a function to compute state of the world at the start of a game.

<initial-world> ::=

    (define board-size 11)
    (define (make-initial-world)
      (define initial-board
        (add-n-random-blocked-cells
         6
         (empty-board board-size)
         board-size))
      (make-world initial-board
                  (make-posn (quotient board-size 2)
                             (quotient board-size 2))
                  'playing
                  board-size
                  #f
                  #f))

Finally, we can define and provide a function to start the game by calling
big-bang with the appropriate arguments.

<go> ::=

    (provide main)
    (define (main)
      (void
       (big-bang (make-initial-world)
                 (on-draw render-world
                          (world-width board-size)
                          (world-height board-size))
                 (on-key change)
                 (on-release release)
                 (on-mouse clack)
                 (name "Chat Noir"))))
