2 Implementing New Games

The game-starting console inspects the sub-collections of the "games"
collection. If a sub-collection has an "info.rkt" module (see setup/infotab),
the following fields of the collection’s "info.rkt" file are used:

  • game [required] : used as a module name in the sub-collection to load for
    the game; the module must provide a game@ unit (see scheme/unit) with no
    particular exports; the unit is invoked with no imports to start the game.

  • name [defaults to the collection name] : used to label the game-starting
    button in the game console.

  • game-icon [defaults to collection name with ".png"] : used as a path to a
    bitmap file that is used for the game button’s label; this image should be
    32 by 32 pixels and have a mask.

  • game-set [defaults to "Other Games"] : a label used to group games that
    declare themselves to be in the same set.

To implement card games, see games/cards. Card games typically belong in the
"Cards" game set.
