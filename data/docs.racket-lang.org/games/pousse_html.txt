1.13 [pousse] Pousse — Tic-Tac-Toe-like Game

            To play Pousse, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s called
            plt-games).

Pousse (French for “push,” pronounced “poo-ss”) is a 2 person game, played on
an N by N board (usually 4 by 4). Initially the board is empty, and the players
take turns inserting one marker of their color (X or O) on the board. The color
X always goes first. The columns and rows are numbered from 1 to N, starting
from the top left, as in:

      1 2 3 4

     +-+-+-+-+

   1 | | | | |

     +-+-+-+-+

   2 | | | | |

   3 | | | | |

   4 | | | | |

A marker can only be inserted on the board by sliding it onto a particular row
from the left or from the right, or onto a particular column from the top or
from the bottom. So there are 4*N possible “moves” (ways to insert a marker).
They are named Li, Ri, Ti, and Bi respectively, where i is the number of the
row or column where the insertion takes place.

When a marker is inserted, there may be a marker on the square where the
insertion takes place. In this case, all markers on the insertion row or column
from the insertion square up to the first empty square are moved one square
further to make room for the inserted marker. Note that the last marker of the
row or column will be pushed off the board (and must be removed from play) if
there are no empty squares on the insertion row or column.

A row or a column is a straight of a given color if it contains N markers of
the given color.

The game ends either when an insertion

  • repeats a previous configuration of the board; in this case the player who
    inserted the marker LOSES.

  • creates a configuration with more straights of one color than straights of
    the other color; the player whose color is dominant (in number of
    straights) WINS.

A game always leads to a win by one of the two players. Draws are impossible.

This game is from the 1998 ICFP programming contest.
