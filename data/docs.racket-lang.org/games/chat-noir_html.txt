1.18 [chat-noir] Chat Noir — Puzzle Game

Robby Findler,
Eli Barzilay,
and Matthew Flatt

The goal of Chat Noir is to stop the cat from escaping the board. Each turn you
click on a circle, which prevents the cat from stepping on that space, and the
cat responds by taking a step. If the cat is completely boxed in and thus
unable reach the border, you win. If the cat does reach the border, you lose.

To start a new game, hit the “n” key (but only after losing or winning a game).

            To play Chat Noir, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s
            called plt-games).

To get some insight into the cat’s behavior, hold down the “h” key. It will
show you the cells that are on the cat’s shortest path to the edge, assuming
that the cell underneath the mouse has been blocked, so you can experiment to
see how the shortest paths change by moving your mouse around.

The game was inspired by the one at Game Design and has essentially the same
rules. It also inspired the final project for the introductory programming
course at the University of Chicago in the fall of 2008.

The remainder of this document explains the implementation of the Chat Noir
game in a Literate Programming style.
