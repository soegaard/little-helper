1.6 [spider] Spider — Solitaire Card Game

            To play Spider, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s called
            plt-games).

Spider is a solitaire card game played with 104 cards. The cards can include
either a single suit, two suits, or four suites. (Choose your variant through
the Options item in the Edit menu.)

Terminology:

  • Tableau: one of the ten stacks of cards in the play area. The game starts
    with six cards in the first four tableaus, and five cards in the rest; only
    the topmost card is face up, and others are revealed when they become the
    topmost card of the tableau.

  • Sequence: a group of cards on the top of a tableau that are in the same
    suit, and that are in sequence, with the lowest numbered card topmost
    (i.e., closer to the bottom of the screen). King is high and ace is low.

The object of the game is to create a sequence with ace through king, at which
point the sequence is removed from play. Create eight such sequences to win the
game.

On each move, you can take one of the following actions:

  • Move a sequence from any tableau to one whose topmost card (i.e., closest
    to the bottom of the screen) has a value that’s one more than the sequence
    ’s value. Note that if the top card of the target tableau has the same suit
    as the sequence, a larger sequence is formed, but the target tableau’s card
    is not required to have the same suit.

  • Move a sequence to an empty tableau.

  • Deal ten cards from the deck (in the upper left corder), one to each
    tableau. This move is allowed only if no tableau is empty.

To move a sequence, either drag it to the target tableau, or click the sequence
and then click the top card of the target tableau (or the place where a single
card would be for an empty tableau). Click a select card to de-select it.
Clicking a card that is not a valid target for the currently selected sequence
causes the clicked card’s sequence to be selected (if the card is face up in a
sequence).

To deal, click the deck.

To undo a move, use Undo from the Edit menu.
