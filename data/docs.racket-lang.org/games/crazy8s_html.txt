1.3 [crazy8s] Crazy 8s — Card Game

            To play Crazy 8s, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s
            called plt-games).

Try to get rid of all you cards by matching the value or suit of the top card
in the discard pile. In the default mode, click a card to discard it; you can
adjust the options so that you discard by dragging a card from your hand to the
discard pile.

An 8 can be discarded at any time, and in that case, the player who discarded
the 8 gets to pick any suit for it (hence the craziness of 8s). When you
discard an 8, a panel of buttons appears to the right of the discard pile, so
you can pick the suit.

A player can choose to draw a card instead of discarding, as long as cards are
left in the draw pile. A player’s turn continues after drawing, so a player can
continue drawing to find something to discard. In the default mode, click the
face-down draw pile in the middle of the table; you can adjust the options to
that you draw by dragging it from the draw pile to your hand.

If no cards are left in the deck, a player may pass instead of discarding. To
pass, click the Pass button.

The status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as you go.
