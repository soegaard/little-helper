4 Showing Text Help

 (require games/show-help)

(show-help coll-path frame-title [verbatim?]) → (-> any)
  coll-path : (listof string?)
  frame-title : string?
  verbatim? : any/c = #f
Returns a thunk for showing a help window based on plain text. Multiple
invocations of the thunk bring the same window to the foreground (until the
user closes the window).

The help window displays "doc.txt" from the collection specified by coll-path.

The frame-title argument is used for the help window title.

If verbatim? is true, then "doc.txt" is displayed verbatim, otherwise it is
formatted as follows:

  • Any line of the form **....** is omitted.

  • Any line that starts with * after whitespace is indented as a bullet point.

  • Any line that contains only -s and is as long as the previous line causes
    the previous line to be formatted as a title.

  • Other lines are paragraph-flowed to fit the window.
