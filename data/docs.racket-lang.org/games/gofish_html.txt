1.2 [gofish] Go Fish — Kid’s Card Game

            To play Go Fish, run the PLT Games program. (Under Unix, it’s
            called plt-games).

Go Fish is the children’s card game where you try to get rid of all you cards
by forming pairs. You play against two computer players.

On each turn, if you have a match in your hand, drag one of the matching cards
to your numbered box, and the match will move into the box.

After forming matches from your own hand, drag one of your cards to an
opponent’s area to ask the opponent for a matching card:

  • If the opponent has a card with the same value as the card that you drag,
    the opponent will give you the card, and they’ll go into your match area.
    Drag another card to an opponent.

  • If the opponent has no matching card, the top card on draw pile will move,
    indicating that you must “Go Fish!” Draw a card by dragging it from the
    draw pile to your hand. If the drawn card gives you a match, then the match
    will automatically move into your match area, and it’s still your turn (so
    drag another card to one of the opponents).

The game is over when one player runs out of cards. The winner is the one with
the most matches.

The status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as you go.
The computer players are not particularly smart.
