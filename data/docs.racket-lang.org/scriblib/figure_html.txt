(figure-here tag caption pre-flow ...) → block?
  tag : string?
  caption : content?
  pre-flow : pre-flow?
Creates a figure. The given tag is for use with figure-ref or Figure-ref. The
caption is an element. The pre-flow is decoded as a flow.

For HTML output, the figure and figure* functions center the figure content,
while figure** allows the content to be wider than the document body. For
two-column Latex output, figure* and figure** generate a figure that spans
columns.

For Latex output, figure-here generates a figure to be included at the position
in the output text where the figure-here occurs in the source text. For HTML
output, all figure variants place the figure where the use appears in the
source text.

(figure-ref tag) → element?
  tag : string?
Generates a reference to a figure, using a lowercase word “figure”.

(Figure-ref tag) → element?
  tag : string?
Generates a reference to a figure, capitalizing the word “Figure”.

(Figure-target tag) → element?
  tag : string?
Generates a new figure label. This function is normally not used directly,
since it is used by figure.
