4 BibTeX Bibliographies

 (require scriblib/bibtex)

(define-bibtex-cite bib-pth ~cite-id citet-id generate-bibliography-id)
Parses bib-pth as a BibTeX database.

Uses define-cite from scriblib/autobib, but augments the ~cite-id and citet-id
functions so that rather than accepting bib? structures, they accept citation
key strings.

Each string is broken along spaces into citations keys that are looked up in
the BibTeX database and turned into bib? structures.
