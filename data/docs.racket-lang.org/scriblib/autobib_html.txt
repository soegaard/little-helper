3 Bibliographies

 (require scriblib/autobib)

(define-cite ~cite-id citet-id generate-bibliography-id)
Binds ~cite-id, citet-id, and generate-bibliography-id, which share state to
accumulate and render citations.

The function bound to ~cite-id produces a citation referring to one or more
bibliography entries with a preceding non-breaking space, by default sorting
the entries to match the bibliography order. It has the contract

    (->* (bib?) (#:sort? any/c) #:rest (listof bib?) element?)

The function bound to citet-id generates an element suitable for use as a noun—
referring to a document or its author—for one or more bibliography entries
which share an author. It has the contract

    (->* (bib?) () #:rest (listof bib?) element?)

The function bound to generate-bibliography-id generates the section for the
bibliography. It has the contract

    (->* () (#:tag string? #:sec-title string?) part?)

The default value for the #:tag argument is "doc-bibliography" and for
#:sec-title is "Bibliography".

(bib? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v is a value produced by make-bib or in-bib, #f otherwise.

(make-bib    #:title title              
           [ #:author author            
             #:is-book? is-book?        
             #:location location        
             #:date date                
             #:url url])           →   bib?
  title : any/c
  author : any/c = #f
  is-book? : any/c = #f
  location : any/c = #f
  date : any/c = #f
  url : string? = #f
Produces a value that represents a document to cite. Except for is-book? and
url, the arguments are used as elements, except that #f means that the
information is not supplied. Functions like proceedings-location, author-name,
and authors help produce elements in a standard format.

An element produced by a function like author-name tracks first, last names,
and name suffixes separately, so that names can be ordered and rendered
correctly. When a string is provided as an author name, the last non-empty
sequence of alphabetic characters or - after a space is treated as the author
name, and the rest is treated as the first name.

(in-bib orig where) → bib?
  orig : bib?
  where : string?
Extends a bib value so that the rendered citation is suffixed with where, which
might be a page or chapter number.

(proceedings-location    location                 
                       [ #:pages pages            
                         #:series series          
                         #:volume volume])   →   element?
  location : any/c
  pages : (or (list/c any/c any/c) #f) = #f
  series : any/c = #f
  volume : any/c = #f
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing a
paper’s location within a conference or workshop proceedings.

(journal-location    title                    
                   [ #:pages pages            
                     #:number number          
                     #:volume volume])   →   element?
  title : any/c
  pages : (or (list/c any/c any/c) #f) = #f
  number : any/c = #f
  volume : any/c = #f
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing a
paper’s location within a journal.

(book-location  [ #:edition edition              
                  #:publisher publisher])   →   element?
  edition : any/c = #f
  publisher : any/c = #f
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing a
book’s location.

(techrpt-location  [ #:institution institution]        
                     #:number number)             →   element?
  institution : edition = any/c
  number : any/c
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing a
technical report’s location.

(dissertation-location  [ #:institution institution        
                          #:degree degree])           →   element?
  institution : edition = any/c
  degree : any/c = "PhD"
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing a
dissertation.

(author-name first last [#:suffix suffix]) → element?
  first : any/c
  last : any/c
  suffix : any/c = #f
Combines elements to generate an element that is suitable for describing an
author’s name, especially where the last name is not merely a sequence of ASCII
alphabet letters or where the name has a suffix (such as “Jr.”).

(authors name ...) → element?
  name : any/c
Combines multiple author elements into one, so that it is rendered and
alphabetized appropriately. If a name is a string, it is parsed in the same way
as by make-bib.

(org-author-name name) → element?
  name : any/c
Converts an element for an organization name to one suitable for use as a
bib-value author.

(other-authors) → element?
Generates an element that is suitable for use as a “others” author. When
combined with another author element via authors, the one created by
other-authors renders as “et al.”

(editor name) → element?
  name : name/c
Takes an author-name element and create one that represents the editor of a
collection. If a name is a string, it is parsed in the same way as by make-bib.
