4 Testing Utilities

4.1 Checking documentation completeness

 (require rackunit/docs-complete)

(check-docs lib [#:skip skip]) → any
  lib : symbol?
              (or/c regexp?
                    symbol?
   skip   :         (listof (or/c regexp? symbol?))   =   #f
                    (-> symbol? any)
                    #f)
Checks to see if the module path named by lib (e.g. 'racket/list) has
documented all of its exports and prints an error message to (
current-error-port) if not.

If skip is a regexp, then exporting matching that regexp are ignored. If it is
a symbol, then that export is ignored. If it is a list of symbols and regexps,
then any exporting matching any of the symbols or regexps are ignored. If it is
a function, the function is treated as a predicate and passed each export of
the module. If skip is #f, no exports are skipped.
