6 Release Notes

6.1 Version 3.4

This version allows arbitrary expressions within test suites, fixing the
semantics issue below.

There are also miscellaneous Scribble fixes.

6.2 Version 3

This version of RackUnit is largely backwards compatible with version 2 but
there are significant changes to the underlying model, justifying incrementing
the major version number. These changes are best explained in The Philosophy of
RackUnit.

There are a few omissions in this release, that will hopefully be corrected in
later minor version releases:

  • There is no graphical UI, and in particular no integration with DrRacket.

  • The semantics of test-suite are not the desired ones. In particular, only
    checks and test cases have their evaluation delayed by a test suite; other
    expressions will be evaluated before the suite is constructed. This won’t
    affect tests written in the version 2 style. In particular this doesn’t
    effect test suites that contain other test suites; they continue to work in
    the expected way. However people incrementally developing tests from plain
    checks to test suites might be surprised. I’m hoping that few enough people
    will do this that no-one will notice before it’s fixed.
