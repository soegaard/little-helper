1.5 MasterMinding: "master.ss"

 (require htdp/master)

The teachpack implements GUI for playing a simple master mind-like game, based
on a function designed by a student. The player clicks on two colors and the
program responds with an answer that indicates how many colors and places were
correct.

(master check-guess) → symbol?
  check-guess : (-> symbol? symbol? symbol? symbol? boolean?)
Chooses two “secret” colors and then opens a graphical user interface for
playing MasterMind. The player is prompted to choose two colors, via a choice
tablet and mouse clicks. Once chosen, master uses check-guess to compare them.

If the two guesses completely match the two secret colors, check-guess must
return 'PerfectGuess; otherwise it must return a different, informative symbol.
