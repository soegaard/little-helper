1.8 Hangman: "hangman.ss"

 (require htdp/hangman)

The teachpack implements the callback functions for playing a Hangman game,
based on a function designed by a student. The player guesses a letter and the
program responds with an answer that indicates how many times, if at all, the
letter occurs in the secret word.

(hangman make-word reveal draw-next-part) → true
  make-word : (-> symbol? symbol? symbol? word?)
  reveal : (-> word? word? word?)
  draw-next-part : (-> symbol? true)
Chooses a “secret” three-letter word and uses the given functions to manage the
Hangman game.

(hangman-list   reveal-for-list        
                draw-next-part)   →   true
   reveal-for-list   :   (-> symbol? (list-of symbol?) (list-of symbol?)
                             (list-of symbol?))
  draw-next-part : (-> symbol? true)
Chooses a “secret” word—a list of symbolic letters—and uses the given functions
to manage the Hangman game: reveal-for-list determines how many times the
chosen letter occurs in the secret word; draw-next-part is given the symbolic
name of a body part and draws it on a separately managed canvas.

In addition, the teachpack re-exports the entire functionality of the drawing
library; see Simple Drawing: "draw.ss" for documentation.
