1.17 Lookup GUI: "lkup-gui.ss"

 (require htdp/lkup-gui)

The teachpack provides three functions:

(control index) → symbol?
  index : natural-number?
reads out the indexth guess choice, starting with 0

(view msg) → true/c
  msg : (or/c string? symbol?)
displays its msg argument in the message panel

(connect event-handler) → true/c
  event-handler : (-> button% event% true/c)
connects a controller (handler) with the Check button displays frame

Example:

    (connect
     (lambda (e b)
       (view (control))))

This example simply mirrors what the user types in to the message field.
