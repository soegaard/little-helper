1.12 Working with Files and Directories: "dir.ss"

 (require htdp/dir)

The teachpack provides structures and functions for working with files and
directories:

(struct   dir (name dirs files)
          #:extra-constructor-name make-dir)
  name : symbol?
  dirs : (listof dir?)
  files : (listof file?)

(struct   file (name size content)
          #:extra-constructor-name make-file)
  name : symbol?
  size : integer?
  content : (listof char?)

(create-dir path) → dir?
  path : symbol?
Turns the directory found at path on your computer into an instance of dir?.

Sample: Set teachpack to "dir.rkt" and click Run:

    > (create-dir ".")
    (make-dir
      '|.|
      empty
      (cons (make-file 'ball1.gif 1289 empty)
            (cons (make-file 'blueball.gif 205 empty)
                  (cons (make-file 'greenbal.gif 204 empty)
                        (cons (make-file 'redball.gif 203 empty)
                              (cons (make-file 'ufo.gif 1044 empty)
                                    (cons (make-file 'gif-test.rkt 5811 empty)
                                          empty)))))))

Using “.” usually means the directory in which your program is located. In this
case, the directory contains no sub-directories and six files.

Note: Soft links are always treated as if they were empty files.
