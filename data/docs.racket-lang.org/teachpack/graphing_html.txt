1.13 Graphing Functions: "graphing.ss"

 (require htdp/graphing)

The teachpack provides two functions for graphing functions in the regular
(upper right) quadrant of the Cartesian plane (between 0 and 10 in both
directions):

(graph-fun f color) → true
  f : (-> number?  number?)
  color : symbol?
Draws the graph of f with the given color.

(graph-line line color) → true
  line : (-> number? number?)
  color : symbol?
Draws line, a function representing a straight line, with a given color.

For color symbols, see Simple Drawing: "draw.ss".

In addition, the teachpack re-exports the entire functionality of the drawing
library; see Simple Drawing: "draw.ss" for documentation.
