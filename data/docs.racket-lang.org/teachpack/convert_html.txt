1.3 Converting Temperatures: "convert.ss"

 (require htdp/convert)

The teachpack convert.rkt provides three functions for converting Fahrenheit
temperatures to Celsius. It is useful for a single exercise in HtDP. Its
purpose is to demonstrate the independence of “form” (user interface) and
“function” (also known as “model”).

(convert-gui convert) → true
  convert : (-> number? number?)
Consumes a conversion function from Fahrenheit to Celsius and creates a
graphical user interface with two rulers, which users can use to convert
temperatures according to the given temperature conversion function.

(convert-repl convert) → true
  convert : (-> number? number?)
Consumes a conversion function from Fahrenheit to Celsius and then starts a
read-evaluate-print loop. The loop prompts users to enter a number and then
converts the number according to the given temperature conversion function. A
user can exit the loop by entering “x.”

(convert-file in convert out) → true
  in : string?
  convert : (-> number? number?)
  out : string?
Consumes a file name in, a conversion function from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and
a string out. The program then reads all the number from in, converts them
according to convert, and prints the results to the newly created file out.

Warning: If out already exists, it is deleted.

Example: Create a file with name "in.dat" with some numbers in it, using your
favorite text editor on your computer. Define a function f2c in the Definitions
window and set teachpack to "convert.rkt" and click Run. Then evaluate

    (convert-gui f2c)
    ; and
    (convert-file "in.dat" f2c "out.dat")
    ; and
    (convert-repl f2c)

Finally inspect the file "out.dat" and use the repl to check the answers.
