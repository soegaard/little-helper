1.11 Manipulating Simple HTML Documents: "docs.ss"

 (require htdp/docs)

The teachpack provides three functions for creating simple “HTML” documents:

Annotation An Annotation is a symbol that starts with “<” and ends in “>”. An
end annotation is one that starts with “</”.

(atom? x) → boolean?
  x : any/c
Determines whether or not a value is a number, a symbol, or a string.

(annotation? x) → boolean?
  x : any/c
Determines whether or not a symbol is a document annotation.

(end-annotation x) → Annotation
  x : Annotation
Consumes an annotation and produces a matching ending annotation.

(write-file l) → true
  l : (list-of atom)
Consumes a list of symbols and annotations and prints them out as a "file".

Sample session: set teachpack to "docs.rkt" and click Run:

    > (annotation? 0)
    false
    > (annotation? '<bold>)
    true
    > (end-annotation 0)
    end-annotation: not an annotation: 0
    > (write-file (list 'a 'b))
    a b
