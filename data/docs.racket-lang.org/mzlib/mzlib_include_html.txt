 (require mzlib/include)

Similar to scheme/include, but with a different syntax for paths.

(include path-spec)
 
path-spec   =   string
            |   (build-path elem ...+)
            |   (lib file-string collection-string ...)
                 
     elem   =   string
            |   up
            |   same
Inlines the syntax in the designated file in place of the include expression.
The path-spec can be any of the following:

  • A literal string that specifies a path to include, parsed according to the
    platform’s conventions (which means that it is not portable).

  • A path construction of the form (build-path elem ...+), where build-path is
    module-identifier=? either to the build-path export from mzscheme or to the
    top-level build-path, and where each elem is a path string, up (unquoted),
    or same (unquoted). The elems are combined in the same way as for the
    build-path function to obtain the path to include.

  • A path construction of the form (lib file-string collection-string ...),
    where lib is free or refers to a top-level lib variable. The
    collection-strings are passed to collection-path to obtain a directory; if
    no collection-stringss are supplied, "mzlib" is used. The file-string is
    then appended to the directory using build-path to obtain the path to
    include.

If path-spec specifies a relative path to include, the path is resolved
relative to the source for the include expression, if that source is a complete
path string. If the source is not a complete path string, then path-spec is
resolved relative to the current load relative directory if one is available,
or to the current directory otherwise.

The included syntax is given the lexical context of the include expression.

(include-at/relative-to context source path-spec)
(include-at/relative-to/reader context source path-spec reader-expr)
(include/reader path-spec reader-expr)
Variants of include analogous to the variants of scheme/include.
