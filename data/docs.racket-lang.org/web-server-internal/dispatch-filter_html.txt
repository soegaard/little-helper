2.6 Filtering Requests

 (require web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-filter)
The web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-filter module defines a dispatcher
constructor that calls an underlying dispatcher with all requests that pass a
predicate.
(make regex inner) → dispatcher/c
  regex : regexp?
  inner : dispatcher/c
Calls inner if the URL path of the request, converted to a string, matches
regex. Otherwise, calls next-dispatcher.
