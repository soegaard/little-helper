2.11 Serving Files

 (require web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-files)
The web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-files module allows files to be served. It
defines a dispatcher construction procedure.
(make    #:url->path url->path                    
       [ #:path->mime-type path->mime-type        
         #:indices indices])                 →   dispatcher/c
  url->path : url->path/c
   path->mime-type   :   (path? . -> . bytes?)
                     =   (lambda (path) TEXT/HTML-MIME-TYPE)
  indices : (listof string?) = (list "index.html" "index.htm")
Uses url->path to extract a path from the URL in the request object. If this
path does not exist, then the dispatcher does not apply and next-dispatcher is
invoked. If the path is a directory, then the indices are checked in order for
an index file to serve. In that case, or in the case of a path that is a file
already, path->mime-type is consulted for the MIME Type of the path. The file
is then streamed out the connection object.

This dispatcher supports HTTP Range GET requests and HEAD requests.
