2.10 Virtual Hosts

 (require web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-host)
The web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-host module defines a dispatcher
constructor that calls a different dispatcher based upon the host requested.
(make lookup-dispatcher) → dispatcher/c
  lookup-dispatcher : (symbol? . -> . dispatcher/c)
Extracts a host from the URL requested, or the Host HTTP header, calls
lookup-dispatcher with the host, and invokes the returned dispatcher. If no
host can be extracted, then 'none is used.
