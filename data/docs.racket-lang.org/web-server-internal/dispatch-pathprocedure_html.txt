2.7 Procedure Invocation upon Request

 (require web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-pathprocedure)
The web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-pathprocedure module defines a dispatcher
constructor for invoking a particular procedure when a request is given to a
particular URL path.
(make path proc) → dispatcher/c
  path : string?
  proc : (request? . -> . response?)
Checks if the request URL path as a string is equal to path and if so, calls
proc for a response.

This is used in the standard Web Server pipeline to provide a URL that
refreshes the password file, servlet cache, etc.
