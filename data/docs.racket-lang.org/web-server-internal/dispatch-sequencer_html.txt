2.3 Sequencing

 (require web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-sequencer)
The web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-sequencer module defines a dispatcher
constructor that invokes a sequence of dispatchers until one applies.
(make dispatcher ...) → dispatcher/c
  dispatcher : dispatcher/c
Invokes each dispatcher, invoking the next if the first calls next-dispatcher.
If no dispatcher applies, then it calls next-dispatcher itself.
