5.7 URL Param

 (require web-server/private/url-param)
The Web Server needs to encode information in URLs. If this data is stored in
the query string, than it will be overridden by browsers that make GET requests
to those URLs with more query data. So, it must be encoded in URL params. This
module provides functions for helping with this process.

(insert-param u k v) → url?
  u : url?
  k : string?
  v : string?
Associates k with v in the final URL param of u, overwritting any current
binding for k.

(extract-param u k) → (or/c string? false/c)
  u : url?
  k : string?
Extracts the string associated with k in the final URL param of u, if there is
one, returning #f otherwise.
