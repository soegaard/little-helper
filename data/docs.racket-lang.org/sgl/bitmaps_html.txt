5 Bitmaps

 (require sgl/bitmap)

(bitmap->gl-list    bitmap                        
                  [ #:with-gl with-gl-proc        
                    #:mask mask])            →   exact-integer?
  bitmap : (is-a?/c bitmap%)
  with-gl-proc : ((-> any) . -> . any) = (lambda (f) (f))
   mask   :   (or/c (is-a?/c bitmap%) false/c)
          =   (send bitmap get-loaded-mask)
Converts the given bitmap into an OpenGL list that can be rendered with
gl-call-list or glCallList. The rendered object is a square on the z=0 plane
with corners at (0,0) and (1,1).

The with-gl-proc must accept a thunk and call it while the relevant OpenGL
context is selected. Otherwise, the relevant OpenGL context must be selected
already.

If mask is not #f, it is used as the mask bitmap for extracting alpha values.
