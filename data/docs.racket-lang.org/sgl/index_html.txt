GL: 3-D Graphics

Scott Owens

The sgl libraries provide access to the rendering functions of OpenGL 1.5 and 
GLU 1.3 libraries. The sgl libraries to not address system-level concerns, such
as the attachment of GL rendering contexts to displays. Instead, the libraries
should work with any Racket extension that provides GL with access to the
system (such as a binding for glx). Notably, the racket/gui/base library
provides support for rendering contexts via the canvas% class and its
with-gl-context method.
