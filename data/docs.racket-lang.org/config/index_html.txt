Config: Installation and Search Paths

1 Configuring Directories and Search Paths

 (require config)
The config library specifies the location of directories (such as the main
documentation directory) and also directory search paths (such as a list of
directories to search for documentation).

Note: Instead of requireing config directly, use the setup/dirs library, which
combines information from config and other sources.

The config module must export the following values. In all cases where a
delayed value is expected for an exported identifier, the value can be a
delayed #f to indicate the default.

doc-dir : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, or byte string for the main documentation directory. It
defaults to a "doc" sibling directory of the main collection directory.

lib-dir : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, or byte string for the main directory containing C
libraries and build information; it defaults to a "lib" sibling directory of
the main collection directory.

dll-dir : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, or byte string for a directory containing Unix shared
libraries for the main executable; it defaults to the main C-library directory

include-dir : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, or byte string for the main directory containing C
header files; it defaults to an "include" sibling directory of the main
collection directory.

bin-dir : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, or byte string for the main directory containing
executables; it defaults to a "bin" sibling directory of the main collection
directory.

doc-search-dirs : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
A delayed path, string, byte string, or #f representing the search path for
documentation; each #f in the list, if any, is replaced with the default search
path, which is the user- and version-specific "doc" directory followed by the
main documentation directory.

lib-search-dirs : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
Like doc-search-dirs, but for directories containing C libraries and other
build information

include-search-dirs : (promise/c (or/c path? string? bytes? false/c))
Like doc-search-dirs, but for directories containing C header files

absolute-installation? : boolean?
A (simple, non-delayed) boolean that is #t if the installation uses absolute
path names, #f otherwise.

cgc-suffix : (promise/c (or/c string? false/c))
A delayed string used as the suffix (before the actual suffix, such as ".exe")
for a "CGC" executable. Use Windows-style casing, and the string will be
downcased as appropriate (e.g., for a Unix binary name). A #f value means that
if the mzscheme binary identifies itself as CGC, then the suffix is "",
otherwise it is "CGC".

3m-suffix : (promise/c (or/c string? false/c))
Analogous to cgc-suffix, but for 3m. A #f value means that if the "mzscheme"
binary identifies itself as CGC, then the suffix is "3m", otherwise it is "".

2 Overriding the Installation’s Configuration

A user can override an installation’s configuration through a "config"
collection in the user’s collection directory (which normally takes precedence
over the main collection directory).

3 Configuration Language

 (require setup/configtab)
The setup/configtab library defines a language module that can be used to
implement config.

When setup/configtab is used as a language module, the module body must consist
of a sequence of

    (define id val)

declarations, where each id is one of the names that the config library must
export, and val is an expression for the value (which will be automatically
wrapped with delay when needed). If a required export has no corresponding
define, a definition with #f is inserted automatically.
