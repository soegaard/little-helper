1.5 Tabbed Editing

DrRacket’s allows you to edit multiple files in a single window via tabs. The
File|New Tab menu item creates a new tab to show a new file. Each tab has its
own interactions window.

In the General sub-pane of the Editing pane in the preferences window, a
checkbox labelled Open files in separate tabs causes DrRacket to open files in
new tabs in the frontmost window, rather than opening a new window for the
file.

The key bindings Control-Pageup and Control-Pagedown move between tabs. On Mac
OS X, Command-Shift-Left and Command-Shift-Right also move between tabs.
