3.3 Keyboard Shortcuts

Most key presses simply insert a character into the editor, such as a, 3, or (.
Other keys and key combinations act as keyboard shortcuts that move the
blinking caret, delete a line, copy the selection, etc. Keyboard shortcuts are
usually trigger by key combinations using the Control, Meta, or Command key.

            Many of the key-binding actions can also be performed with menu
            items.

C-‹key› means press the Control key, hold it down and then press ‹key› and then
release them both. For example: C-e (Control-E) moves the blinking caret to the
end of the current line.

M-‹key› is the same as C-‹key›, except with the Meta key. Depending on your
keyboard, Meta may be called “Left,” “Right,” or have a diamond symbol, but
it’s usually on the bottom row next to the space bar. M-‹key› can also be
performed as a two-character sequence: first, strike and release the Escape
key, then strike ‹key›. On Windows and Mac OS X, Meta is only available through
the Escape key.

DEL is the Delete key.

SPACE is the Space bar.

On most keyboards, “<” and “>” are shifted characters. So, to get M->, you
actually have to type Meta-Shift->. That is, press and hold down both the Meta
and Shift keys, and then strike “>”.

On Windows, some of these keybindings are actually standard menu items. Those
keybindings will behave according to the menus, unless the Enable keybindings
in menus preference is unchecked.

If you are most familiar with Emacs-style key bindings, you should uncheck the
Enable keybindings in menus preference. Many of the keybindings below are
inspired by Emacs.}

3.3.1 Moving Around

  • C-f : move forward one character

  • C-b : move backward one character

  • M-f : move forward one word

  • M-b : move backward one word

  • C-v : move forward one page

  • M-v : move backward one page

  • M-< : move to beginning of file

  • M-> : move to end of file

  • C-a : move to beginning of line (left)

  • C-e : move to end of line (right)

  • C-n : move to next line (down)

  • C-p : move to previous line (up)

  • M-C-f : move forward one S-expression

  • M-C-b : move backward one S-expression

  • M-C-u : move up out of an S-expression

  • M-C-d : move down into a nested S-expression

  • M-C-SPACE : select forward S-expression

  • M-C-p : match parentheses backward

  • M-C-left : move backwards to the nearest editor box

  • A-C-left : move backwards to the nearest editor box

  • M-C-k : cut complete sexpression

  • M-( : wrap selection in parentheses

  • M-[ : wrap selection in square brackets

  • M-{ : wrap selection in curly brackets

  • M-S-L : wrap selection in (lambda () ...) and put the insertion point in
    the arglist of the lambda

  • C-c C-o : the sexpression following the insertion point is put in place of
    its containing sexpression

  • C-c C-e : the first and last characters (usually parentheses) of the
    containing expression are removed

  • C-c C-l : wraps a let around the sexpression following the insertion point
    and puts a printf in at that point (useful for debugging).

  • M-o : toggle overwrite mode

3.3.3 File Operations

  • C-x C-w : save file under new name

3.3.4 Search

3.3.5 Miscellaneous

  • F5 : Run

3.3.6 Interactions

The interactions window has all of the same keyboard shortcuts as the
definitions window plus a few more:

  • M-p : bring the previously entered expression down to the prompt

  • M-n : bring the expression after the current expression in the expression
    history down to the prompt

3.3.7 LaTeX and TeX inspired keybindings

  • C-\ M-\ c:x;l : traces backwards from the insertion point, looking for a
    backslash followed by a LaTeX macro name or a prefix of such a name. If a
    macro name is found, it replaces the backslash and the name with the
    corresponding key in the table below; if a (proper) prefix p is found, it
    replaces p with the longest common prefix of all macro names that have p as
    a prefix (unless there is only one such name, in which case it behaves as
    if p were a complete macro name).

    These are the currently supported macro names and the keys they map into:

3.3.8 Defining Custom Shortcuts

The Add User-defined Keybindings... menu item in the Keybindings sub-menu of
Edit selects a file containing Racket definitions of keybindings. The file must
contain a module that uses a special keybindings language, framework/
keybinding-lang. To do so, begin your file with this line:

    #lang s-exp framework/keybinding-lang

The framework/keybinding-lang languages provides all of the bindings from
racket, racket/class, and drracket/tool-lib, except that it adjusts #
%module-begin to introduce a keybinding form:

    (keybinding string-expr proc-expr)

    Declares a keybinding, where string-expr must produce a suitable first
    argument for map-function in keymap%, and the proc-expr must produce a
    suitable second argument for add-function in keymap%.

For example, this remaps the key combination “control-a” key to “!”.

    #lang s-exp framework/keybinding-lang
    (keybinding "c:a" (λ (editor evt) (send editor insert "!")))

Note that DrRacket does not reload this file automatically when you make a
change, so you’ll need to restart DrRacket to see changes to the file.
