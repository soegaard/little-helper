1.2 Choosing a Language

DrRacket supports multiple dialects of Racket, as well as some non-Racket
languages. You specify a language in one of two ways:

  • Select the Use the language declared in the source option (via the Language
    |Choose Language... menu item), and then specify a specific language as
    part of the program usually by starting the definitions-window content with
    #lang.

  • Select the Language|Choose Language... menu item, and choose a specific
    language. After changing the language, click Run to reset the language in
    the interactions window. The bottom-left corner of DrRacket’s main window
    also has a shortcut menu item for selecting previously selected languages.

Using a language declared in a program’s source is the recommend mode, and it
is described further in Language Declared in Source.

The Language|Choose Language... dialog contains a Show Details button for
configuring certain details of the chosen language. Whenever the selected
options do not match the default language specification, a Custom indicator
appears next to the language-selection control at the top of the dialog.

See Languages (later in this manual) for more information on the languages that
DrRacket supports.
