3.1 Menus

3.1.1 File

  • New : Creates a new DrRacket window.

  • Open... : Opens a find-file dialog for choosing a file to load into a
    definitions window.

  • Open Recent : Lists recently opened files. Choosing one of them opens that
    file for editing.

  • Install PLT File... : Opens a dialog asking for the location of the ".plt"
    file (either on the local disk or on the web) and installs the contents of
    the file.

  • Revert : Re-loads the file that is currently in the definitions window. All
    changes since the file was last saved will be lost.

  • Save Definitions : Saves the program in the definitions window. If the
    program has never been saved before, a save-file dialog appears.

  • Save Definitions As... : Opens a save-file dialog for choosing a
    destination file to save the program in the definitions window. Subsequent
    saves write to the newly-selected file.

  • 
    Save Other : Contains these sub-items
      □ Save Definitions As Text... : Like Save Definitions As..., but the file
        is saved in plain-text format (see Program Files). Subsequent saves
        also write in plain-text format.

      □ Save Interactions : Saves the contents of the interactions window to a
        file. If the interaction constants have never been saved before, a
        save-file dialog appears.

      □ Save Interactions As... : Opens a save-file dialog for choosing a
        destination file to save the contents of the interactions window.
        Subsequent saves write to the newly-selected file.

      □ Save Interactions As Text... : Like Save Interactions As..., but the
        file is saved in plain-text format (see Program Files). Subsequent
        saves are write in plain-text format.

  • Log Definitions and Interactions... : Starts a running of log of the text
    in the interactions and definitions windows, organized by executions. In a
    directory of your choosing, DrRacket saves files with the names
    "01-definitions", "01-interactions", "02-definitions", "02-interactions",
    etc. as you interact with various programs.

  • Print Definitions... : Opens a dialog for printing the current program in
    the definitions window.

  • Print Interactions... : Opens a dialog for printing the contents of the
    interactions window.

  • Search in Files... : Opens a dialog where you can specify the parameters of
    a multi-file search. The results of the search are displayed in a separate
    window.

  • Close : Closes this DrRacket window. If this window is the only open
    DrRacket window, then DrRacket quits, except on Mac OS X.

  • {Quit or Exit} Exits DrRacket. (On Mac OS X, this menu item is in the Apple
    menu.)

3.1.2 Edit

All Edit menu items operate on either the definitions or interactions window,
depending on the location of the selection or blinking caret. Each window
maintains its own Undo and Redo history.

  • Undo : Reverses an editing action. Each window maintains a history of
    actions, so multiple Undo operations can reverse multiple editing actions.

  • Redo : Reverses an Undo action. Each window (and boxed-subwindow) maintains
    its own history of Undo actions, so multiple Redo operations can reverse
    multiple Undo actions.

  • Cut : Copies the selected text to the clipboard and deletes it from the
    window.

  • Copy : Copies the selected text to the clipboard.

  • Paste : Pastes the current clipboard contents into the window.

  • Delete : or Clear : Deletes the selected text.

  • Select All : Highlights the entire text of the buffer.

  • Wrap Text : Toggles between wrapped text and unwrapped text in the window.

  • Find... : Opens an interactive search window at the bottom of the frame and
    moves the insertion point to the search string editor (or out of it, if the
    insertion point is already there).

    See also Searching.

  • Find Again : Finds the next occurrence of the text in the search window.

  • Find Again Backwards : Finds the next occurrence of the text in the search
    window, but searching backwards.

  • Replace & Find Again : Replaces the selection with the replace string (if
    it matches the find string) and finds the next occurrence of the text that
    was last searched for, looking forwards.

  • Replace & Find Again Backwards : Replaces the selection with the replace
    string (if it matches the find string) and finds the next occurrence of the
    text that was last searched for, looking backwards.

  • Replace All : Replaces all occurrences of the search string with the
    replace string.

  • Find Case Sensitive : Toggles between case-sensitive and case-insensitive
    search.

  • 
    Keybindings :
      □ Show Active Keybindings : Shows all of the keybindings available in the
        current window.

      □ Add User-defined Keybindings... : Choosing this menu item opens a file
        dialog where you can select a file containing Racket-definitions of
        keybindings. See Defining Custom Shortcuts for more information.

  • Complete Word : Completes the word at the insertion point, using the
    manuals as a source of completions.

  • Preferences... : Opens the preferences dialog. See Preferences. (On Mac OS
    X, this menu item is in the Apple menu.)

3.1.3 View

One each of the following show/hide pairs of menu items appears at any time.

  • Show Definitions : Shows the definitions window.

  • Hide Definitions : Hides the definitions window.

  • Show Interactions : Shows interactions window.

  • Hide Interactions : Hides interactions window.

  • Show Program Contour : Shows a “20,000 foot” overview window along the edge
    of the DrRacket window. Each pixel in this window corresponds to a letter
    in the program text.

  • Hide Program Contour : Hides the contour window.

  • Show Module Browser : Shows the module DAG rooted at the currently opened
    file in DrRacket.

    See also The Module Browser.

    See also The Module Browser.

  • 
    Toolbar :
      □ Toolbar on Left : Moves the tool bar (on the top of DrRacket’s window
        by default) to the left-hand side, organized vertically.

      □ Toolbar on Top : Moves the toolbar to the top of the DrRacket window.

      □ Toolbar on Right : Moves the tool bar to the right-hand side, organized
        vertically.

      □ Toolbar Hidden : Hides the toolbar entirely.

  • Show Log : Shows the current log messages.

  • Hide Log : Hides the current log messages.

  • Show Profile : Shows the current profiling report. This menu is useful only
    if you have enabled profiling in the Choose Language... dialog’s Details
    section. Profiling does not apply to all languages.

  • Hide Profile : Hides any profiling information currently displayed in the
    DrRacket window.

  • Dock Test Report : Like the dock button on the test report window, this
    causes all test report windows to merge with the appropriate DrRacket
    window at the bottom of the frame.

  • Undock Test Report : Like the undock button on the test report window, this
    causes the test reports attached to appropriate DrRacket tabs to become
    separate windows.

  • Show Tracing : Shows a trace of functions called since the last time Run
    was clicked. This menu is useful only if you have enabled tracing in the
    Choose Language... dialog’s Details section. Profiling does not apply to
    all languages.

  • Hide Tracing : Hides the tracing display.

  • Split : Splits the current window in half to allow for two different
    portions of the current window to be visible simultaneously.

  • Collapse : If the window has been split before, this menu item becomes
    enabled, allowing you to collapse the split window.

Note: whenever a program is run, the interactions window is made visible if it
is hidden.

3.1.4 Language

  • Choose Language... : Opens a dialog for selecting the current evaluation
    language. Click Run to make the language active in the interactions window.
    See Choosing a Language for more information about the languages.

  • Add Teachpack... : Opens a find-file dialog for choosing a teachpack to
    extend the current language. Click Run to make the teachpack available in
    the interactions windows. See Extending DrRacket for information on
    creating teachpacks.

  • Clear All Teachpacks : Clears all of the current teachpacks. Click Run to
    clear the teachpack from the interactions window.

In addition to the above items, a menu item for each teachpack that clears only
the corresponding teachpack.

3.1.5 Racket

  • Run : Resets the interactions window and runs the program in the
    definitions window.

  • Break : Breaks the current evaluation.

  • Kill : Terminates the current evaluation.

  • Limit Memory... : Allow you to specify a limit on the amount of memory that
    a program running in DrRacket is allowed to consume.

  • Clear Error Highlight : Removes the red background that signals the source
    location of an error. Also removes the highlighting for uncovered
    (untested) portions of the program.

  • Create Executable... : Creates a separate launcher for running your
    program. See Creating Executables for more info.

  • Module Browser... : Prompts for a file and then opens a window showing the
    module DAG starting at the module in the selected file.

    See also The Module Browser.

  • Module Browser on file : Opens a separate window showing the module graph
    rooted at the file currently being edited in DrRacket, but using the saved
    file on the disk, instead of the version in DrRacket.

    See also The Module Browser.

  • Reindent : Indents the selected text according to the standard Racket
    formatting conventions. (Pressing the Tab key has the same effect.)

  • Reindent All : Indents all of the text in either the definitions or
    interactions window, depending on the location of the selection or blinking
    caret.

  • Comment Out with Semicolons : Puts ; characters at each of the beginning of
    each selected line of text.

  • Comment Out with a Box : Boxes the selected text with a comment box.

  • Uncomment : Removes all ; characters at the start of each selected line of
    text or removes a comment box around the text. Uncommenting only removes a
    ; if it appears at the start of a line and it only removes the first ; on
    each line.

  • Disable Tests : Stops tests written in the definitions window from
    evaluating when the program is Run. Tests can be enabled using the Enable
    Tests menu item. Disabling tests freezes the contents of any existing test
    report window.

  • Enable Tests : Allows tests written in the definitions window to evaluate
    when the program is Run. Tests can be disabled using the Disable Tests menu
    item.

3.1.6 Insert

  • Insert Comment Box : Inserts a box that is ignored by DrRacket; use it to
    write comments for people who read your program.

  • Insert Image... : Opens a find-file dialog for selecting an image file in
    GIF, BMP, XBM, XPM, PNG, or JPG format. The image is treated as a value.

  • Insert Fraction... : Opens a dialog for a mixed-notation fraction, and
    inserts the given fraction into the current editor.

  • Insert Large Letters... : Opens a dialog for a line of text, and inserts a
    large version of the text (using semicolons and spaces).

    Most of the dialog is self-explanatory: type in the top space to preview
    the semicolons in the bottom area. The numbers in the font choice item show
    the (relative) widths of the letter “w” in the given font to help you pick
    out the more boldfaced fonts (which tend to look better).

  • Insert λ : Inserts the symbol λ (as a Unicode character) into the program.
    The λ symbol is normally bound the same as lambda.

  • Insert XML Box : Inserts an XML; see XML Boxes and Racket Boxes for more
    information.

  • Insert Racket Box : Inserts a box to contain Racket code, typically used
    inside an XML box; see XML Boxes and Racket Boxes.

  • Insert Racket Splice Box : Inserts a box to contain Racket code, typically
    used inside an XML box; see also XML Boxes and Racket Boxes.

  • Insert Pict Box : Creates a box for generating a Slideshow picture. Inside
    the pict box, insert and arrange Racket boxes that produce picture values.

3.1.7 Windows

  • Bring Frame to Front... : Opens a window that lists all of the opened
    DrRacket frames. Selecting one of them brings the window to the front.

  • Most Recent Window : Toggles between the currently focused window and the
    one that most recently had the focus.

Additionally, after the above menu items, this menu contains an entry for each
window in DrRacket. Selecting a menu item brings the corresponding window to
the front.

    documentation about DrRacket and its language.

  • About DrRacket... : Shows the credits for DrRacket.

  • Related Web Sites : Provides links to related web sites.

  • Tool Web Sites : Provides links to web sites for installed tools.

  • Interact with DrRacket in English : Changes DrRacket’s interface to use
    English; the menu item appears only when the current language is not
    English. Additional menu items switch DrRacket to other languages.
