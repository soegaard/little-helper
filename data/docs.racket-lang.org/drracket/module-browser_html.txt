1.9 The Module Browser

The module browser shows you the structure of all of the files in your program.
It can be opened via the Show menu, or via the Module Browser menu items in the
Racket menu.

A module browser window contains a square for each module. The squares are
colored based on the number of lines of code in the module. If a module has
more lines of code, it gets a darker color.

In addition, for each normal import, a blue line drawn is from the module to
the importing module. Similarly, purple lines are drawn for each for-syntax,
for-template or for-meta import. In the initial module layout, modules to the
left import modules to the right, but since modules can be moved around
interactively, that property might not be preserved.

To open the file corresponding to the module, double click on the box for that
module.

The module browser will also show you the phases that each module is loaded in;
choose the “Long, with phases” menu item in the “Names” pop-up menu. The
integers indicate the phases and if #f is present, it means the module is
loaded for-label.

The bar along the bottom helps you find your way in a module graph.
Specifically, if you type something there, then all of the modules whose
filenames match what you type will turn green in the module window. This bar is
only visible in the stand alone module browser window (via the Racket menu)
