27 Platform Dependencies

On Windows and Mac OS X, the Racket distribution includes all necessary
libraries that are not part of a stock installation of the operating system,
and the libraries are included in any distribution created with raco distribute
(see raco distribute: Sharing Stand-Alone Executables).

On Unix, the following system libraries must be installed. Numbers in square
brackets indicate a version that is tried first, and if that fails, the name
without the version is tried.

  • "libglib-2.0[.0]"

  • "libgmodule-2.0[.0]"

  • "libgobject-2.0[.0]"

  • "libpango-1.0[.0]"

  • "libpangocairo-1.0[.0]"

  • "libcairo[.2]"

  • "libjpeg[.62]"

  • "libpng12[.0]" or "libpng"
