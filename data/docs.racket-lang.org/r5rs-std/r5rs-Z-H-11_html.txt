Notes

Language changes

This section enumerates the changes that have been made to Scheme since the
``Revised^4 report'' [6] was published.

  • The report is now a superset of the IEEE standard for Scheme [13]:
    implementations that conform to the report will also conform to the
    standard. This required the following changes:

      □ The empty list is now required to count as true.

      □ The classification of features as essential or inessential has been
        removed. There are now three classes of built-in procedures: primitive,
        library, and optional. The optional procedures are load,
        with-input-from-file, with-output-to-file, transcript-on,
        transcript-off, and interaction-environment, and - and / with more than
        two arguments. None of these are in the IEEE standard.

      □ Programs are allowed to redefine built-in procedures. Doing so will not
        change the behavior of other built-in procedures.

  • Port has been added to the list of disjoint types.

  • The macro appendix has been removed. High-level macros are now part of the
    main body of the report. The rewrite rules for derived expressions have
    been replaced with macro definitions. There are no reserved identifiers.

  • Syntax-rules now allows vector patterns.

  • Multiple-value returns, eval, and dynamic-wind have been added.

  • The calls that are required to be implemented in a properly tail-recursive
    fashion are defined explicitly.

  • `@' can be used within identifiers. `|' is reserved for possible future
    extensions.
