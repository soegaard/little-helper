Test Box Recovery Tool

The text-box recovery tool allows DrRacket or DrScheme v370 and later to read
programs created using v360 and earlier that include test-case boxes.

When opened using this tool, test-case boxes are turned into check-expect
forms.

Test boxes plain-text tests and expected results are converted to plain-text
check-expect forms.

If either the test or expected-result expression contains non-text (e.g., an
image), the converted form is a comment box containing a check-expect form. The
box should be easy to remove using the Racket|Uncomment menu item in DrRacket.
