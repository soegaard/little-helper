Honu

Honu is a family of languages built on top of Racket. Honu syntax resembles
Java. Like Racket, however, Honu has no fixed syntax, because Honu supports
extensibility through macros and a base syntax of H-expressions, which are
analogous to S-expressions.

The Honu language currently exists only as a undocumented prototype. Racket’s
parsing and printing of H-expressions is independent of the Honu language,
however, so it is documented here.
