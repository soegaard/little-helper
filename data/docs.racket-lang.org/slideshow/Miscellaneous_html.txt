2.8 Miscellaneous

(hyperlinkize pict) → pict?
  pict : pict?
Adds an underline and blue color. The pict’s height and descent are extended.

(scale-color factor color) → (is-a?/c color%)
  factor : real?
  color : (or/c string (is-a?/c color%))
Scales a color, making it brighter or darker. If the factor is less than 1, the
color is darkened by multiplying the RGB components by the factor. If the
factor is greater tham 1, the color is lightened by dividing the gap between
the RGB components and 255 by the factor.

  dc : (is-a?/c dc<%>)
  max-step : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  step-delta : (and/c exact? positive?)
  start : (or/c string? (is-a?/c color%))
  end : (or/c string? (is-a?/c color%))
  proc : (exact? . -> . any)
  set-pen? : any/c
  set-brush? : any/c
Calls a proc multiple times, gradually changing the pen and/or brush color for
each call. For the first call, the current pen and/or brush color matches
start; for the last call, it matches end; and for intermediate calls, the color
is an intermediate color.

The max-step and step-delta arguments should be exact numbers; the procedure is
called with each number from 0 to max-step inclusive using a step-delta
increment.
