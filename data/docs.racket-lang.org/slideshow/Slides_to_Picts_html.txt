3.7 Slides to Picts

 (require slideshow/slides-to-picts)

(get-slides-as-picts    path                
                        width               
                        height              
                        condense?           
                      [ stop-after])   →   (listof pict?)
  path : path-string?
  width : real?
  height : real?
  condense? : any/c
  stop-after : (or/c #f exact-nonnegative-integer?) = #f
Executes the Slideshow program indicated by path in a fresh namespace, and
returns a list of picts for the slides. Each pict has the given width and
height, and condense? determines whether the Slideshow program is executed in
condense mode.

If stop-after is not #f, then the list is truncated after stop-after slides are
converted to picts.
