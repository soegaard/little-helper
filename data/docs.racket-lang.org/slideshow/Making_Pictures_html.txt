2 Making Pictures

 (require slideshow/pict)
The slideshow/pict layer provides core functions for constructing pictures, and
it is independent of the slide viewer. This layer can be used, for example, to
generate a picture as encapsulated PostScript for inclusion into a larger
document. The slideshow/pict layer is re-provided by the slideshow language.
