Slideshow: Figure and Presentation Tools

Matthew Flatt
and Robert Bruce Findler

Slideshow is a library for creating presentation slides. Unlike Powerpoint,
Slideshow provides no WYSIWYG interface for constructing slides. Instead, like
SliTeX, a presentation is generated by a program.

To get started, run the slideshow executable, and click the Run Tutorial link.

To learn more about why Slideshow is cool, see also “Slideshow: Functional
Presentations” [Findler06].

 #lang slideshow
Most of the bindings defined in the manual are provided by the slideshow
language, which also re-exports all of racket except for printable<%> (due to
backward-compatibility issues).
