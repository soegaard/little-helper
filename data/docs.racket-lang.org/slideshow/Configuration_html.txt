3.5 Configuration

(current-font-size) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
(current-font-size n) → void?
  n : exact-nonnegative-integer?
Parameter that determines he font size used by t, para, etc. The default size
is 32.

(current-main-font) → text-style/c
(current-main-font style) → void?
  style : text-style/c
Parameter that determines the font size used by t, para, etc. The default is
platform-specific; possible initial values include 'swiss, "Verdana", and "Gill
Sans".

(current-line-sep) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
(current-line-sep n) → void?
  n : exact-nonnegative-integer?
Parameter that controls the amount of space used between lines by para, item,
and subitem.

(current-para-width) → exact-nonnegative-integer?
(current-para-width n) → void?
  n : exact-nonnegative-integer?
Parameter that controls the width of a pict created by para, item, and subitem.

(current-title-color) → (or/c string? (is-a?/c color%))
(current-title-color color) → void?
  color : (or/c string? (is-a?/c color%))
Parameter used by the default current-titlet to colorize the title. The default
is "black".

                                ((or/c string? #f)
                                 exact-nonnegative-integer?
(current-slide-assembler)   →    pict?
                                 . -> .
                                 pict?)
(current-slide-assembler proc) → void?
              ((or/c string? #f)
               exact-nonnegative-integer?
   proc   :    pict?
               . -> .
               pict?)
Parameter whose value is a function for assembling slide content into a single
pict; the assembling function takes a string for the title (or #f), a
separation for the title (if any) and pict, and a pict for the slide content
(not counting the title).

The result is of the assembler is ct-superimposed with the client area, but the
result pict might draw outside the client region to paint the screen margins,
too.

The default assembler uses titlet to turn a title string (if any) to a pict.
See also current-titlet and set-title-h!,.

The slide assembler is not responsible for adding page numbers to the slide;
that job belongs to the viewer. See also current-page-number-font,
current-page-number-color, and set-page-numbers-visible!.

(current-titlet) → (string? . -> . pict?)
(current-titlet proc) → void?
  proc : (string? . -> . pict?)
Parameter to configure titlet. The default is

    (lambda (s)
      (colorize (text s (current-main-font) 40)
                (current-title-color)))

If this parameter is changed such that the result is a different height, then
set-title-h! should be called to update the value produced by title-h,
titleless-page, etc.

(set-margin! amt) → void?
  amt : real?
Changes the margin that surrounds the client area. See also margin.

(set-title-h! amt) → void?
  amt : real?
Changes the expected height of a title, which adjusts title-h, client-h,
full-page, and titleless-page.

(make-slide-inset   left-inset           
                    top-inset            
                    right-inset          
                    bottom-inset)   →   slide-inset?
  left-inset : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  top-inset : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  right-inset : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  bottom-inset : exact-nonnegative-integer?
Creates a slide inset, which describes a number of pixels to inset the viewer
for a slide on each side.

(slide-inset? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v is a slide inset created by make-slide-inset, #f otherwise.
