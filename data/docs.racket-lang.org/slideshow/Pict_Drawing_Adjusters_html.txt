2.4 Pict Drawing Adjusters

(scale pict factor) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  factor : real?
(scale pict w-factor h-factor) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  w-factor : real?
  h-factor : real?
Scales a pict drawing, as well as its bounding-box. The drawing is scaled by
adjusting the destination dc<%>’s scale while drawing the original pict.

(rotate pict theta) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  theta : real?
Rotates a pict’s drawing by theta radians counter-clockwise.

The bounding box of the resulting pict is the box encloses the rotated corners
of pict (which inflates the area of the bounding box, unless theta is a
multiple of half of pi). The ascent and descent lines of the result’s bounding
box are the horizontal lines that bisect the rotated original lines; if the
ascent line drops below the descent line, the two lines are flipped.

(ghost pict) → pict?
  pict : pict?
Creats a container picture that doesn’t draw the child picture, but uses the
child’s size.

(linewidth w pict) → pict?
  w : (or/c real? #f)
  pict : pict?
Selects a specific pen width for drawing, which applies to pen drawing for pict
that does not already use a specific pen width. A #f value for w makes the pen
transparent (in contrast to a zero value, which means “as thin as possible for
the target device”).

(colorize pict color) → pict?
  pict : pict?
               (or/c string?
                     (is-a?/c color%)
   color   :         (list (integer-in 0 255)
                           (integer-in 0 255)
                           (integer-in 0 255)))
Selects a specific color drawing, which applies to drawing in pict that does
not already use a specific color. The black-and-white parameter causes all
non-white colors to be converted to black.

(cellophane pict opacity) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  opacity : (real-in 0 1)
Makes the given pict semi-transparent, where an opacity of 0 is fully
transparent, and an opacity of 1 is fully opaque. See set-alpha for information
about the contexts and cases when semi-transparent drawing works.

(clip pict) → pict
  pict : pict?
Clips a pict’s drawing to its bounding box.

(inset/clip pict amt) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  amt : real?
(inset/clip pict h-amt v-amt) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  h-amt : real?
  v-amt : real?
(inset/clip pict l-amt t-amt r-amt b-amt) → pict?
  pict : pict?
  l-amt : real?
  t-amt : real?
  r-amt : real?
  b-amt : real?
Insets and clips the pict’s drawing to its bounding box. Usually, the inset
amounts are negative.

(scale/improve-new-text pict-expr scale-expr)
(scale/improve-new-text pict-expr x-scale-expr y-scale-expr)
Like the scale procedure, but also sets current-expected-text-scale while
evaluating pict-expr.

(black-and-white) → boolean?
(black-and-white on?) → void?
  on? : any/c
A parameter that determines whether colorize uses color or black-and-white
colors.
