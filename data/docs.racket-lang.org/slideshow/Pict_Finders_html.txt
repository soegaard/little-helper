(rb-find pict find)   →   real?   real?
  pict : pict?
  find : pict-path?
Locates a pict designated by find is within pict. If find is a pict, then the
pict must have been created as some combination involving find.

If find is a list, then the first element of find must be within pict, the
second element of find must be within the second element, and so on.

(pict-path? v) → boolean?
  v : any/c
Returns #t if v is a pict or a non-empty list of picts.

(launder pict) → pict?
  pict : pict?
Creates a pict that has the same drawing and bounding box of pict, but which
hides all of its sub-picts so that they cannot be found with functions like
lt-find. If pict has a last-line pict, then the laundered pict has a fresh
last-line pict with the same shape and location.
