3.6 Pict-Staging Helper

 (require slideshow/step)
The slideshow/step library provides syntax for breaking a complex slide into
steps that are more complex than can be handled with 'next and 'alts in a slide
sequence.

(with-steps (id ...) body ...)
Evaluates the bodys once for each id, skipping an id if its name ends with ~
and condense? is true. The results of the last body for each iteration are
collected into a list, which is the result of the with-steps form.

Within the bodys, several keywords are bound non-hygienically (using the first
body’s lexical context):

  • (only? id) — returns #t during the id step (i.e., during the evaluation of
    the bodys for id), #f otherwise.

  • (vonly id) — returns the identity function during the id step, ghost
    otherwise.

  • (only id then-expr) returns the result of then-expr during the id step,
    values otherwise.

  • (only id then-expr else-expr) returns the result of then-expr during the id
    step, the result of else-expr otherwise.

  • (before? id) — returns #t before the id step, #f starting for the id and
    afterward.

  • (vbefore id), (before id then-expr), or (before id then-expr else-expr) —
    analogous to vonly and only.

  • (after? id) — returns #t after the id step, #f through the id step.

  • (vafter id), (after id then-expr), or (after id then-expr else-expr) —
    analogous to vonly and only.

  • (between? a-id b-id) — returns #t starting from the a-id step through the
    b-id step, #f otherwise.

  • (vbetween a-id b-id), (between a-id b-id then-expr), or (between a-id b-id
    then-expr else-expr) — analogous to vonly and only.

  • (between-excel? a-id b-id) — returns #t starting from the a-id step through
    steps before the b-id step, #f for the b-id step and afterward.

  • (vbetween-excl a-id b-id), (between-excl a-id b-id then-expr), or
    (between-excl a-id b-id then-expr else-expr) — analogous to vonly and only.

(with-steps~ (id ...) body ...)
Like with-steps, but when condense? is true, then expr is evaluated only for
the last id (independent of whether the name fo the last id name ends in ~).
