2.9 Rendering

(dc-for-text-size) → (or/c #f (is-a?/c dc<%>))
(dc-for-text-size dc) → void?
  dc : (or/c #f (is-a?/c dc<%>))
A parameter that is used to determine the bounding box of picts created with
text.

The drawing context installed in this parameter need not be the same as the
ultimate drawing context, but it should measure text in the same way. Under
normal circumstances, font metrics are the same for all drawing contexts, so
the default value of dc-for-text-size is a bitmap-dc% that draws to a 1-by-1
bitmap.

(draw-pict pict dc x y) → void?
  pict : pict?
  dc : (is-a?/c dc<%>)
  x : real?
  y : real?
Draws pict to dc, with its top-left corner at offset (x, y).

(make-pict-drawer pict)
 → ((is-a?/c dc<%>) real? real? . -> . void?)
  pict : pict?
Generates a pict-drawer procedure for multiple renderings of pict. Using the
generated procedure can be faster than repeated calls to draw-pict.

(show-pict pict [w h]) → void?
  pict : pict?
  w : (or/c #f exact-nonnegative-integer?) = #f
  h : (or/c #f exact-nonnegative-integer?) = #f
Opens a frame that displays pict. The frame adds one method, set-pict, which
takes a pict to display. The optional w and h arguments specify a minimum size
for the frame’s drawing area.

(current-expected-text-scale) → (list real? real?)
(current-expected-text-scale scales) → void?
  scales : (list real? real?)
A parameter used to refine text measurements to better match an expected
scaling of the image. The scale/improve-new-text form sets this parameter while
also scaling the resulting pict.
