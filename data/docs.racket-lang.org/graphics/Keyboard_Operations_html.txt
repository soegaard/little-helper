11 Keyboard Operations

The graphics library contains functions that report key presses from the
keyboard. The functions get-key-press and ready-key-press return a “key-press
descriptor,” and then key-value takes the descriptor and returns a character or
symbol (usually a character) representing the key that was pressed. Key presses
are buffered and returned in the same order in which they occurred. Thus, the
descriptors returned by get-key-press and ready-key-press may be from presses
that occurred long before these functions were called.

(get-key-press viewport) → key-press?
  viewport : viewport?
Returns the next key press in the viewport, waiting for a key press if
necessary.

(ready-key-press viewport) → key-press?
  viewport : viewport?
Returns the next key press in the viewport or returns #f if none is available.
Unlike get-key-press, ready-key-press always returns immediately.

(key-value key-press) → (or/c character? symbol?)
  key-press : key-press?
Returns a character or special symbol for the key that was pressed. For
example, the Enter key generates #\return, and the up-arrow key generates 'up.
For a complete list of possible return values, see get-key-code.
