3 Color Operations

A color can be represented in three ways: as a color index (an integer in 0 to
299, inclusive), as a color name string, or as a rgb value. All drawing
functions which take a color argument accept colors in any form. An rgb value
is assigned to an index with change-color.

(struct   rgb (red green blue)
          #:extra-constructor-name make-rgb)
  red : (real-in 0 1)
  green : (real-in 0 1)
  blue : (real-in 0 1)
Takes three values in the range 0 (dark) to 1 (bright) and returns an rgb (a
color).

(change-color index rgb) → void?
  index : (integer-in 0 299)
  rgb : rgb?
Changes the color at index in the color table to the color specified in rgb.
Only the first twenty-one indices are initialized; a color index should not be
used until it has been initialized.

(default-display-is-color?) → boolean?
Returns #t if the default display screen for viewports is in color or #f
otherwise.
