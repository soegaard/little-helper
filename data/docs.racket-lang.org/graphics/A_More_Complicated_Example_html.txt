8 A More Complicated Example

The use of multiple viewports, viewport descriptors, drawing operations for
multiple viewports is as easy as the use of a single viewport:

    (open-graphics)
    (let* (; w1 and w2 are viewports for different windows
           [w1  (open-viewport "viewport 1" 300 300)]
           [w2  (open-viewport "viewport 2" 200 500)]
           ; d1 and d2 draw lines in different viewports
           [d1  (draw-line w1)]
           [d2  (draw-line w2)])
      ; draws a line in viewport labeled “viewport 1”
      (d1 (make-posn 100 5) (make-posn 5 100))
      ; draws a line in viewport labeled “viewport 2”
      (d2 (make-posn 100 100) (make-posn 101 400)))
     
    ; we no longer have access to viewports 1 and 2,
    ; since their descriptors did not escape the let
    (close-graphics)
    ; removes the viewports
