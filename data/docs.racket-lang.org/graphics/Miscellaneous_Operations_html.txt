6 Miscellaneous Operations

((get-string-size viewport) str) → (list/c real? real?)
  viewport : viewport?
  str : string?
Returns the size of str as drawn into viewport as a list of two numbers: width
and height.

(viewport->snip viewport) → (is-a?/c snip%)
  viewport : viewport?

Returns an object that can be inserted into an editor buffer to display the
current image in the viewport. (Subsequent drawing to the viewport does not
affect the snip’s image.)

shows the snip in the interactions window.}

(viewport-dc viewport) → (is-a?/c dc<%>)

Returns an object for direct drawing into viewport’s on-screen representation
(if any). Mirror all such drawing to the result of (viewport-buffer-dc
viewport), too.

(viewport-buffer-dc viewport) → (is-a?/c dc<%>)
  viewport : viewport?
