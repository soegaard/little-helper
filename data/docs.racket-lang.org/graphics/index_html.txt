Graphics: Legacy Library

 (require graphics/graphics)

The viewport graphics library is a relatively simple toolbox of graphics
commands. The library is not very powerful; it is intended as a simplified
alternative to racket/gui’s full graphical toolbox.

The graphics library originated as SIXlib, a library of X Windows commands
available within Chez Scheme at Rice University. The functionality of that
library has been reproduced (with backward compatibility) in this version.
