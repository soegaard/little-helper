9 Protecting Graphics Operations

To guarantee the proper closing of viewports in cases of errors, especially
when a program manages several viewports simultaneously, a programmer should
use dynamic-wind:

    (let ([w (open-viewport "hello" 100 100)])
      (dynamic-wind
        ; what we want to happen first: nothing
        void
        ; the main program (errors constrained to this piece)
        (lambda () (draw-pixel 13))  ; an error
        ; what we would like to happen, whether the main program
        ; finishes normally or not
        (lambda () (close-viewport w))))
