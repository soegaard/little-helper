The report gives a defining description of the standard libraries of the
programming language Scheme.

This report frequently refers back to the Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme [11]; references to the report are identified by designations
such as “report section” or “report chapter”.

Parts of the library report are derived from earlier revisions of the report [8
]. We gratefully acknowledge their authors for their contributions. More
detailed information on authorship can be found at the beginning of the Revised
^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.

We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so we grant
permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee. In particular, we
encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as a starting point for
manuals and other documentation, modifying it as necessary.
