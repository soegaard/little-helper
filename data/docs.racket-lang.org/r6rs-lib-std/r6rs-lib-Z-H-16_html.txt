Chapter 15

Composite library

The (rnrs (6)) library is a composite of most of the libraries described in
this report. The only exceptions are:

  • (rnrs eval (6)) (chapter 16)

  • (rnrs mutable-pairs (6)) (chapter 17)

  • (rnrs mutable-strings (6)) (chapter 18)

  • (rnrs r5rs (6)) (chapter 19)

The library exports all procedures and syntactic forms provided by the
component libraries.

All of the bindings exported by (rnrs (6)) are exported for both run and
expand; see report section on “Import and export levels”.
