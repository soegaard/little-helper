Chapter 9

File system

This chapter describes the (rnrs files (6))library for operations on the file
system. This library, in addition to the procedures described here, also
exports the I/O condition types described in section 8.1.

(file-exists? filename)    procedure 

Filename must be a file name (see section 8.2.1). The file-exists? procedure
returns #t if the named file exists at the time the procedure is called, #f
otherwise.

(delete-file filename)    procedure 

Filename must be a file name (see section 8.2.1). The delete-file procedure
deletes the named file if it exists and can be deleted, and returns unspecified
values. If the file does not exist or cannot be deleted, an exception with
condition type &i/o-filename is raised.
