Command-line access and exit values

The procedures described in this section are exported by the (rnrs programs
(6))library.

(command-line)    procedure 

Returns a nonempty list of strings. The first element is an
implementation-specific name for the running top-level program. The remaining
elements are command-line arguments according to the operating systemâ€™s
conventions.

(exit)    procedure 
(exit obj)    procedure 

Exits the running program and communicates an exit value to the operating
system. If no argument is supplied, the exit procedure should communicate to
the operating system that the program exited normally. If an argument is
supplied, the exit procedure should translate the argument into an appropriate
exit value for the operating system. If obj is #f, the exit is assumed to be
abnormal.
