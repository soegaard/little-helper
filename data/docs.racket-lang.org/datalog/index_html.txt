Datalog: Deductive Database Programming

Jay McCarthy <jay@racket-lang.org>

Datalog is

  • a declarative logic language in which each formula is a function-free Horn
    clause, and every variable in the head of a clause must appear in the body
    of the clause.

  • a lightweight deductive database system where queries and database updates
    are expressed in the logic language.

The use of Datalog syntax and an implementation based on tabling intermediate
results ensures that all queries terminate.
