3 Parenthetical Datalog Module Language

 #lang datalog/sexp

The semantics of this language is the same as the normal Datalog language,
except it uses the parenthetical syntax described in Racket Interoperability.

All identifiers in racket/base are available for use as predicate symbols or
constant values. Top-level identifiers and datums are not otherwise allowed in
the program. The program may contain require expressions.

The following is a program:

    #lang datalog/sexp
     
    (! (edge a b))
    (! (edge b c))
    (! (edge c d))
    (! (edge d a))
    (! (:- (path X Y)
           (edge X Y)))
    (! (:- (path X Y)
           (edge X Z)
           (path Z Y)))
    (? (path X Y))

This is also a program:

    #lang datalog/sexp
    (require racket/math)
     
    (? (sqr 4 :- X))

The Parenthetical Datalog REPL accepts new statements that are executed as if
they were in the original program text, except require is not allowed.
