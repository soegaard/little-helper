5 Acknowledgments

This package was once structurally based on Dave Herman’s (planet dherman/
javascript) library and John Ramsdell’s Datalog library.

The package uses the tabled logic programming algorithm described in Efficient
Top-Down Computation of Queries under the Well-Founded Semantics by W. Chen, T.
Swift, and D. S. Warren. Another important reference is Tabled Evaluation with
Delaying for General Logic Programs by W. Chen and D. S. Warren. Datalog is
described in What You Always Wanted to Know About Datalog (And Never Dared to
Ask) by Stefano Ceri, Georg Gottlob, and Letizia Tanca.
