MzScheme: Legacy Language

 (require mzscheme)
The mzscheme language provides nearly the same bindings as the mzscheme module
of PLT Scheme version 372 and earlier.

Unlike version 372, the mzscheme language does not include set-car! or set-cdr!
, and cons makes immutable pairs, as in scheme/base; those changes make modules
built on mzscheme reasonably compatible with modules built on scheme/base.

Otherwise, the mzscheme language shares many bindings with scheme/base. It
renames a few bindings, such as syntax-object->datum instead of syntax->datum,
and it provides old versions of some syntactic forms, such as lambda without
support for keyword and optional arguments.
