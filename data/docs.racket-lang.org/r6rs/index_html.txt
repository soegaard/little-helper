R6RS: Scheme

The The Revised6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme defines a dialect of
Scheme. We use R6RS to refer to both the standard and the language defined by
the standard.

            See Dialects of Racket and Scheme for general information about
            different dialects of Scheme within Racket.

R6RS defines both libraries and top-level programs. Both correspond to Racket
modules (see Modules). That is, although R6RS defines top-level programs as
entry points, you can just as easily treat a library as an entry point when
using Racket. The only difference is that an R6RS top-level program cannot
export any bindings to other modules.
