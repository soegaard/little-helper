1 Using R6RS with DrRacket

To run an R6RS program with DrRacket choose Use language declared in source
from the language dialog box and add the following line to the top of your
program. #!r6rs.

Here is a small example R6RS program that will work in DrRacket.

    #!r6rs
    (import (rnrs lists (6))
            (rnrs base (6))
            (rnrs io simple (6)))
    (display (find even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9)))
