3 Libraries Provided With Typed Racket

The typed/racket language corresponds to the racket language—that is, any
identifier provided by racket, such as modulo is available by default in typed/
racket.

    #lang typed/racket
    (modulo 12 2)

The typed/racket/base language corresponds to the racket/base language.

Some libraries have counterparts in the typed collection, which provide the
same exports as the untyped versions. Such libraries include srfi/14, net/url,
and many others.

    #lang typed/racket
    (require typed/srfi/14)
    (char-set= (string->char-set "hello")
               (string->char-set "olleh"))

Other libraries can be used with Typed Racket via require/typed.

    #lang typed/racket
    (require/typed version/check
                   [check-version (-> (U Symbol (Listof Any)))])
    (check-version)
