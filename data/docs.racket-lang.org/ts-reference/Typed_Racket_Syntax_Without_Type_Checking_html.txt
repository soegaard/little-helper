5 Typed Racket Syntax Without Type Checking

 #lang typed/racket/no-check
 #lang typed/racket/base/no-check

On occasions where the Typed Racket syntax is useful, but actual typechecking
is not desired, the typed/racket/no-check and typed/racket/base/no-check
languages are useful. They provide the same bindings and syntax as typed/racket
and typed/racket/base, but do no type checking.

Examples:

    #lang typed/racket/no-check
    (: x Number)
    (define x "not-a-number")
