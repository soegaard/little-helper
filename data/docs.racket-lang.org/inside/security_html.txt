15 Security Guards

Before a primitive procedure accesses the filesystem or creates a network
connection, it should first consult the current security guard to determine
whether such access is allowed for the current thread.

File access is normally preceded by a call to scheme_expand_filename, which
accepts flags to indicate the kind of filesystem access needed, so that the
security guard is consulted automatically.

An explicit filesystem-access check can be made by calling
scheme_security_check_file. Similarly, an explicit network-access check is
performed by calling scheme_security_check_network.

void   scheme_security_check_file ( const char* who,

                                    char* filename,

                                    int guards)

Consults the current security manager to determine whether access is allowed to
filename. The guards argument should be a bitwise combination of the following:

  • SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_READ

  • SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_WRITE

  • SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_EXECUTE

  • SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_DELETE

  • SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_EXISTS (do not combine with other values)

The filename argument can be NULL (in which case #f is sent to the security
manager’s procedure), and guards should be SCHEME_GUARD_FILE_EXISTS in that
case.

If access is denied, an exception is raised.

void   scheme_security_check_network ( const char* who,

                                       char* host,

                                       int portno)

Consults the current security manager to determine whether access is allowed
for creating a client connection to host on port number portno. If host is
NULL, the security manager is consulted for creating a server at port number
portno.

If access is denied, an exception is raised.
