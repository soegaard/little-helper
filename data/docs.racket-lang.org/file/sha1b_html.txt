7 SHA1 Message Digest

 (require file/sha1)

See openssl/sha1 for a faster implementation.

(sha1 in) → string?
  in : input-port
Returns a 40-character string that represents the SHA-1 hash (in hexadecimal
notation) of the content from in, consuming all of the input from in until an
end-of-file.

The sha1 function composes bytes->hex-string with sha1-bytes.

Example:

    > (sha1 (open-input-bytes #"abc"))
    "a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d"



(sha1-bytes in) → bytes?
  in : input-port
Returns a 20-byte byte string that represents the SHA-1 hash of the content
from in, consuming all of the input from in until an end-of-file.

Example:

    > (sha1-bytes (open-input-bytes #"abc"))
    #"\251\231>6G\6\201j\272>%qxP\302l\234\320\330\235"



(bytes->hex-string bstr) → string?
  bstr : bytes?
Converts the given byte string to a string representation, where each byte in
bstr is converted to its two-digit hexadecimal representation in the resulting
string.
