9 Windows Registry

 (require file/resource)

(get-resource    section        
                 entry          
               [ value-box      
                 file           
                 #:type type])  
 → (or/c #f string? bytes? exact-integer? #t)
  section : string?
  entry : string?
   value-box   :   (or/f #f (box/c (or/c string? bytes? exact-integer?)))
               =   #f
  file : (or/c #f fail-path?) = #f
  type : (or/c 'string 'bytes 'integer) = derived-from-value-box
Gets a value from the Windows registry or an ".ini" file. For backward
compatibilty, the result is #f for platforms other than Windows. The registry
is read when file is #f and when section is "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT", 
"HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG", "HKEY_CURRENT_USER", "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE", or 
"HKEY_USERS". When file is #f and section is not one of the special registry
strings, then (build-path (find-system-path 'home-dir) "mred.ini") is read.

The resource value is keyed on the combination of section and entry. The result
is #f if no value is found for the specified section and entry. If value-box is
a box, then the result is #t if a value is found, and the box is filled with
the value; when value-box is #f, the result is the found value.

The type argument determines how a value in the resource is converted to a
Racket value. If value-box is a box, then the default type is derived from the
initial box content, otherwise the default type is 'string.

Registry values of any format can be extracted. Values using the registry
format REG_SZ are treated as strings, and values with the format REG_DWORD are
treated as 32-bit signed integers. All other formats are treated as raw bytes.
Data from the registry is converted to the requested type as follows:

  • A REG_SZ registry value is converted to an integer using string->number
    (using 0 if the result is not an exact integer), and it is converted to
    bytes using string->bytes/utf-8.

  • A REG_DWORD registry value is converted to a string or byte string via
    number->string and (for byte strings) string->bytes/utf-8.

  • Any other kind of registry value is converted to a string or integer using
    bytes->string/utf-8 and (for integers) string->number.

Resources from ".ini" files are always strings, and are converted like REG_SZ
registry values.

To get the “default” value for a registry entry, use a trailing backslash. For
example, the following expression gets a command line for starting a browser:

    (get-resource "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT"
                  "htmlfile\\shell\\open\\command\\")

(write-resource    section                            
                   entry                              
                   value                              
                 [ file                               
                   #:type type                        
                   #:create-key? create-key?])   →   boolean?
  section : string?
  entry : string?
  value : (or/c string? bytes? exact-integer?)
  file : (or/c path-string? #f) = #f
  type : (or/c 'string 'bytes 'integer) = 'string
  create-key? : any/c = #f
Write a value to the Windows registry or an ".ini" file. For backward
compatibilty, the result is #f for platforms other than Windows. The registry
is written when file is #f and when section is "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT",
"HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG", "HKEY_CURRENT_USER", "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE", or
"HKEY_USERS". When file is #f and section is not one of the special registry
strings, then (build-path (find-system-path 'home-dir) "mred.ini") is written.

The resource value is keyed on the combination of section and entry. If
create-key? is false when writing to the registry, the resource entry must
already exist, otherwise the write fails. The result is #f if the write fails
or #t if it succeeds.

The type argument determines the format of the value written to the registry:
'string writes using the REG_SZ format, 'bytes writes using the REG_BINARY
format, and 'dword writes using the REG_DWORD format. Any kind of value can be
converted for any kind of type using the inverse of the conversions for
get-resource.

When writing to an ".ini" file, the format is always a string, independent of
type.
