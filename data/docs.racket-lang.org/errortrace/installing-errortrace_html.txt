2 Installing Errortrace

Invoking the errortrace module sets the compilation handler to instrument
Racket source code. It also sets the error display handler to report source
information for an exception, and it sets the use-compiled-file-paths parameter
to trigger the use of Errortrace-specific ".zo" files.

NOTE: errortrace has no effect on code loaded as compiled byte code (i.e., from
a ".zo" file) or native code (i.e., from a ".dll", ".so" or ".dylib" file). You
can use the --mode errortrace flag to setup-plt to create ".zo" files with
Errortrace information.

Explicitly requiring errortrace within a module is generally a bad idea, since
errortrace sets various parameters.
