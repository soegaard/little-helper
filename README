Little Helper - Full Text Search for the Racket Documentation
=============================================================

This is a small search engine geared towards Racket/Scheme source and documentation.

How To Start the Search Engine
------------------------------

0. Copy the folder data/docs.racket-lang.org to /tmp/docs.racket-lang.org
1. Open and run "web/run-me.rkt".

That's it.

Note: Step 0 will be eliminated in the near future.


Project Description
-------------------

The project comes with:
  - lexers for Scheme source and documentation
  - an indexer based on the algoritms in the book "Managing Gigabytes"
  - ranking algorithm
  - functions for generating snippets around found keywords
  - an pre-made index for docs.racket-lang.org
  - a web interface for making actual searches
  - (mumble) a little cruft here and there
